</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c003'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />IN NO MAN’S LAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Hal Paine and Chester Crawford crouched low
in a shell hole in No Man’s Land. All morning they
had been there and the day had worn on now into
the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hundred yards west of their refuge were
the American lines. Sprinters such as Hal and
Chester could easily have covered the distance in
half a minute; and it was not for want of courage
that so far they had failed to make the effort. It
was plain common sense that kept them in their
present position.</p>

<p class='c005'>On all sides of them—between the American lines
and the most advanced German positions less than
two hundred yards from the spot where the opening
of this story finds the two boys—the ground
was dotted with shell holes similar to the ones in
which Hal and Chester found themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>Less than fifty yards due north of Hal and Chester
was a second inhabited shell hole. From this
four German infantrymen had amused themselves
during the day by taking occasional shots at the
two lads when either exposed himself over the top
of their refuge. This was the reason that Hal and
Chester, once in the comparative safety of the shell
hole, had elected to remain there rather than to risk
a dash toward the American lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same reasoning kept the Germans in their
refuge. They were not willing to risk a shot from
their adversaries by a dash toward the German positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the twentieth day of March, 1918. Although
neither Hal nor Chester knew it then, it
was the eve of what was to prove Germany’s second
grand attempt to sweep back the Allied and American
troops and march triumphantly into Paris.</p>

<p class='c005'>A warm afternoon sun shone down into the shell
hole where Hal and Chester were awaiting the coming
of darkness, when, they had decided, they would
make an effort to reach their own lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess the Boches are not enjoying themselves
any better than we are,” Hal said, as he pulled his
cap farther down over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I imagine they’re fretting a bit worse,” agreed
Chester. “You know the Hun doesn’t bear up very
well under adversity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Adversity?” grinned Hal. “It’s the sun they
are trying to bear up under now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, whatever it is,” declared Chester, somewhat
nettled, “I don’t believe they like it very well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t like it either, but what am I going to do
about it?” Hal wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You might try a little sprint,” Chester suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much. I feel reasonably secure here and
I think I’ll stick awhile. The thing that mystifies
me, though, is why the Germans haven’t sent relief
to our friends in the next hole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“On the same reasoning,” said Chester, “why
hasn’t Captain O’Neil made an effort to reach us?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess he is playing for the safety of the greatest
number,” was his reply. “If he tried to rescue us
the Germans also would probably advance and that
would mean a battle. My idea is that Captain
O’Neil has been ordered to avoid that right now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the same,” said Chester, “they are bound to
know we’re here, and it seems to me they could do
something for us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t croak,” said Hal. “We’re not running
this war, you know, and I guess it’s a good thing.
Anyhow, we’ve just as much chance to get out alive
as those fellows over there,” and he waved an arm
in the direction of the shell hole occupied by the Germans.</p>

<p class='c005'>This act of indiscretion almost proved costly.
When Hal’s arm showed above the top of the shell
hole a German rifle cracked in the distance. Hal
heard the whine of the bullet as it passed within a
fraction of an inch of his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess I’d better hug down inside here,” he said
calmly. “Fritz almost nicked me that time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys became silent. Every moment or two,
one or the other, exercising extreme caution, peered
toward the enemy, for they did not wish to be caught
napping, should the Germans, knowing that the
odds were two to one in their favor, decide to rush
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Almost five o’clock,” he said. “It’ll be dark
soon and then we can get away from here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess Fritz will be as glad as we will,” Hal
commented.</p>

<p class='c005'>As it developed, however, the lads were not to
get back to their own lines so easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>The particular section of the great battle zone in
which the lads found themselves when this story
opens was perhaps ten miles south and west of St.
Quentin, at that time in German hands. The river
Oise flowed some five miles to the east and also was
held by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Darkness now drew on apace and Hal and Chester,
making sure that their rifles and side arms were
in perfect condition, prepared to quit their refuge.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better wait a few minutes,” said Chester. “It’s
not quite dark. We would still make pretty fair
targets on level ground.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It won’t be dark enough to cover us anyhow,”
Hal replied. “See the moon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester gazed aloft.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove! That’s what I call pretty tough luck,”
he said. “Well, we’ll just have to make the most
of it; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sooner we start, then, the sooner we’ll get
there,” declared Hal. “Guns ready?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ready,” was Chester’s brief response.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then let’s be moving. Follow me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal got to his feet, but, with a cry, as suddenly
dropped down again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hit, Hal?” cried Chester, as he stooped over
his chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” replied Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stick out your nose and have a look,” returned
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester did so, and what he saw was this:</p>

<p class='c005'>Twenty-five yards away, and advancing rapidly,
were the four Germans who so recently had occupied
the neighboring shell hole. They were firing
as they advanced and a bullet sped close to Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quick with your rifle, Hal!” the boy cried, and
bringing his own weapon to his shoulder regardless
of his exposed position, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the approaching foes staggered slightly,
but he did not fall. The advancing Germans
pumped rifle bullets the faster.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to stop them or we are done for,”
muttered Hal, as he stood erect in the shell hole.</p>

<p class='c005'>Despite the hail of bullets that flew about him,
Hal was untouched as he took careful aim and fired
at the nearest German.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man stumbled, threw up his arms and flung
his rifle a dozen yards away; then, with a cry, he
pitched forward on his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One,” said Hal quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>A bullet brushed the boy’s cheek, leaving a stream
of red in its wake, but Hal did not quail.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again his rifle spoke and a second German went
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Odds even now,” Hal called to Chester. “Let’s
get these other two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Without waiting for a reply, he leaped from the
shell hole and dashed forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester, who had been unfortunate in his marksmanship
and so far had not accounted for one of
the enemy, followed Hal closely.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two remaining Germans, now realizing that
they had lost the advantage of two-to-one odds,
halted in their impetuous dash forward, turned and
ran. By this time Hal and Chester were close behind
them and the former shouted:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surrender!”</p>

<p class='c005'>For answer the Germans only ran the faster.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” Hal muttered to himself, “if you won’t,
you won’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again he raised his rifle and fired.</p>

<p class='c005'>A third German dropped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester, close behind the remaining foe, also cried
a command to surrender, but the man ran on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Loath to shoot the man from behind, Chester
sprinted and caught up with him. With his rifle in
his right hand, he laid his left on the German’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Halt!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German needed no further urging. He came
to an abrupt stop and raised his hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We might as well take this fellow back with us,”
said Hal, as he approached at that moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are,” agreed Chester. “We can’t
return without some kind of a memento of our trip.
A live souvenir is about the best thing I can think
of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve got me,” mumbled the German at this
juncture, “but I want to tell you that before another
twenty-four hours have passed, my loss will
be repaid with interest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wonder if he knows anything, Hal?” questioned
Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess he’s not so big that the German high command
is tipping him off to all their plans,” said Hal.
“He’s angry and wants to talk. That’s about all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And still it wasn’t all; and had the lads had the
foresight to report the words of their prisoner,
action might have been taken that would have nipped
the second German offensive in the bud.</p>

<p class='c005'>With no further word to their prisoner, the lads
made off in the semi-darkness for the American
lines. These they reached in safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>But hardly had they passed within the lines when
a violent cannonading broke out from the German
front.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sounds as though they were going to start something,”
said Chester. “Maybe our prisoner knows
something after all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I guess not,” replied Hal, and once again
passed by an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later, their prisoner having been
turned over to Captain O’Neil, the lads sought their
own little dugout and much-needed repose.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />ENTOMBED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Hal Paine and Chester Crawford, in spite of
the fact that the United States had not declared war
on Germany until April of 1917, already had seen
virtually four years of fighting in Europe.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had been in Berlin when the European conflagration
broke out and had been with the Allied
armies almost from the first.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads had seen active service with the Belgian,
British, French, Italian and Russian armies
and, through their courage and bravery, had won
captaincies in the British army.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the United States entered the war, Hal and
Chester were among the officers sent back to America
to help train the young men in the various officers’
training camps. When they returned again
to the fighting front with the first contingent of
American troops to join the Allies, it was as first
lieutenants, U. S. A.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through their courage and resourcefulness, both
lads had won the praise of Marshal Joffre,
commander of the French forces, in the early days of
the war, and of Sir Douglas Haig, the British commander-in-chief.
They had also rendered invaluable
service to the Allied cause upon the request of
General Pershing, in command of the American Expeditionary
Forces.</p>

<p class='c005'>Times had changed greatly since the first campaign,
when the German armies advanced to the
very doors of Paris soon after war was declared.
With America sending thousands of men each
month to reinforce the armies of France and Great
Britain, it appeared that the Allies soon would have
the necessary numerical superiority to drive the
enemy out of France and Belgium for all time, and
to strike a decisive blow in the war.</p>

<p class='c005'>So far, while battles of such magnitude as had
never been seen before were fought almost daily,
there had been nothing in the nature of a conflict
that would indicate an ultimate decision. True, the
Germans and Austrians, their allies, had staggered
the Allies with a crushing drive in Italy; but,
through the prompt action of the British and French,
they had been driven back again.</p>

<p class='c005'>It appeared, at this moment, that the next great
blow would be delivered by the Allies; that, with
her numerical superiority overcome, her output of
munitions of war surpassed, Germany from this
time on must remain on the defensive in an effort
to retain what ground she had won in the early days
of the war and to keep her enemies off German
soil.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the twentieth day of March the great battle
line extended, roughly, from Ostend on the North
Sea south to within a few miles of Ypres, thence to
Bailleul and Lens. Here it was pushed slightly
east, touching Bapaume and Peronne. In the Soissons
region the Germans were in possession of
Chauny and Laon. The battle line continued south
to the river Aisne, and then followed that stream east
into Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everywhere, up to this time—that is, since the
early days of the war—success had seemed to crown
the efforts of the Allies on the Western front. On
the Eastern front, however, it was different.
Through German intrigue, Russia had been removed
as a belligerent and more than a million and a half
of German troops had been released to reinforce
the hard-pressed Germans on the west.</p>

<p class='c005'>Though the loss of Russia’s aid in the war was
a severe blow to the Allies, it was more than offset
by the entrance of the United States into the conflict.
American soldiers were being rushed to Europe
with all possible dispatch and were taking their
places on the firing line. Already they had covered
themselves with glory. So far, however, they
had taken part only in what the official dispatches
called “skirmishes,” although, compared to battles
of previous wars, they could be classed as engagements
of more than passing importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the time was coming, and coming soon, when
the Yankee troops would go “over the top” under
command of General Pershing in such force and
with such courage that the Germans could not stand
before them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through the decision of an Allied war council, in
which the United States participated, General Foch
had been made the supreme commander of the Allied
forces—British, American and Italian included.
It was believed that through this unity of command
greater success would be achieved than had yet been
manifest.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the time for Marshal Foch to prove his mettle
was at hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the personal direction of General von
Hindenburg, the greatest military genius that the
war had yet produced, the German forces had been
massed for their second effort to break through to
Paris. Although Marshal Foch had some slight inkling
of the impending attack, he had been unable to
tell just where it would be made. True, his air
scouts had flown time and again over the enemy
lines, but so far they had failed to learn where the
foe would strike.</p>

<p class='c005'>As it developed, the first thrust was made in the
north, with Ypres as the apparent objective; although
after the first few days of the drive it became
apparent that Hindenburg’s real plan was to
get behind Paris from the north, after driving a
wedge between the French and British armies.
This, through the ablest of strategy, Field Marshal
Haig was able to prevent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bailleul, Lens and other important railroad centers
fell to the Germans in the second great enemy
drive of the war. Suddenly, when apparently
checked in the north, the enemy struck farther
south, capturing Bapaume, Albert, Peronne and
other important towns and villages.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Allied line at last held there, the attack
was pressed against Ypres.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this second drive was to fail as had all others,
with a terrible loss to the Germans in manpower.
Marshal Foch sacrificed ground to save
lives, while, on the other hand, the German high
command threw their men forward with an utter
disregard for loss of life.</p>

<p class='c005'>To Hal and Chester, after their return from No
Man’s Land on the night before the opening of the
German advance, it seemed that they had just closed
their eyes when they were awakened by a sudden
loud detonation apparently in their very ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>As both lads jumped to their feet they were borne
down by an avalanche of dirt and concrete. Although
neither lad knew at that moment what had
happened, a German bomb had burst squarely over
their dugout, shattering the little place.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys slept in improvised bunks close to each
other, and in jumping to their feet, they came closer
together. They lay on the floor face down as the
debris continued to rain on them. For the moment
neither was able to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the shower of debris ceased, and Hal
made an effort to rise. He dropped down to the
floor again suddenly with an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter?” asked Chester, sitting up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Matter is,” said Hal, “that I bumped my head.
Seems like the roof has fallen in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester now made an effort to rise. He got to his
feet more cautiously, however, and so did not hurt
himself. Nevertheless, the lad gave an exclamation
of alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bump your head, too?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the trouble then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trouble is,” said Chester, “that we seem to be
buried in here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I guess it’s not as bad as that,” said Hal
hopefully, and, getting to his feet cautiously, he
began to explore.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dugout, before the explosion, had been a
small building, possibly fifteen feet wide and as
many feet long. It was entirely covered by a roof of
wood. This, Hal found by exploration, seemed to
have come down to within five feet of the floor and
to be wedged down by a heavy weight outside.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re buried, all right,” said Hal at last, “but
I guess we can get out. We’ll have to dig.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” said Chester. “Let’s begin. I’ve
got a knife here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal also produced a knife and the lads fell to
work upon the roof at one end. After half an hour
of strenuous work Hal sat down and wiped a moist
brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t seem to be accomplishing much,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should say not,” said Chester as he sat down
beside his chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you,” said Hal after a pause, “I don’t
think we’ll ever dig our way out with these tools,”
and he tapped his knife.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what then?” asked Chester. “We can’t
stay here forever. We’ll suffocate. In fact, the
air is already getting bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I noticed that,” Hal declared, “which is the
reason that I say we can’t get out by digging. We
might eventually dig our way out, if given time;
but the poisonous air will overcome us long before
then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve got to do something, Hal,” said Chester.
“We can’t perish here like rats in a trap without
making an effort to save ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right. Then I’ve a suggestion to offer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s have it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s dangerous,” said Hal quietly, “and may mean
only a quicker death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anything is better than this inaction,” Chester
declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “near my bunk are two hand
grenades. My idea is this! Place them close to
the fallen roof where we have been digging, come
back here and pot them with our revolvers. The
explosion should blow the roof off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Or bury us a little deeper,” said Chester grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course,” said Hal. “However, it’s the only
chance I see. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Try it, of course,” said Chester promptly. “It’s
the only way. Get out your bombs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal did so, and a moment later he had placed
them to his satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess I can hit one in the dark,” he said. “Hug
down close, Chester.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester did so and Hal made himself as small
as possible. A moment later there was a sharp
report, followed by a heavy explosion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />NEW FRIENDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Hal’s last conscious moment was filled with the
roar that followed his shot aimed at the hand grenades
in the far corner of his underground tomb.
When again he was able to realize that he still lived
his first thought was of Chester, who had been near
when he pressed the trigger of his automatic in his
desperate attempt to escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad was very dizzy as he staggered to his feet.
First he felt himself over carefully. He found he
uninjured except from shock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Chester,” he called.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again and again Hal called to his friend, meanwhile
moving through the debris that littered the
ground, until at last he came upon the unconscious
form of Chester fully a hundred yards from the spot
where he himself had come to life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Quickly Hal bent over and raised Chester’s head
to his knee. He still breathed and as the lad glanced
around he noted a pool of stagnant water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Laying Chester down on the ground carefully,
Hal hurried to the pool. There he soaked his handkerchief
and hurried back to his friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>After some effort on Hal’s part Chester showed
signs of returning consciousness as the cold water
began to have its effect. Then Chester sat up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where am I?” he asked, moving his head feebly
in a vain attempt to pierce the darkness with his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal was forced to smile at this remark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess you are not in such bad shape after all,”
he said. “Anybody that can wake up and start off
with a question like that is not going to die for some
time to come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester struggled from Hal’s arms and got to
his feet. He surveyed the ruins of the erstwhile
dugout in the darkness and then said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re getting to be a pretty fair shot with that
gun of yours, Hal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thanks,” said Hal dryly. “You were so still
and quiet when I found you, though, that I had
begun to think I had done a pretty bad job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester, “we’re on the outside again,
at all events. I don’t feel as well as I might, either,
and I vote that we get away from here. I’d like
to lay my hands on the Boche who is responsible
for interrupting my sleep like this. I’d show him a
thing or two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not in your present condition, I guess,” was
Hal’s rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I’m still alive and kicking,” returned Chester.
“But listen to the guns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, it seemed that the roar of heavy artillery
from both the Allied and German lines exceeded in
ferocity anything that either lad had heard in their
fours years of fighting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can bet there is something of importance
going on,” was Hal’s comment. “But I agree with
you, Chester, we’ve time enough later to learn what
it’s all about. It’s time now to find a place where we
can bunk for the rest of the night. Let’s be moving.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Together the lads walked away in the darkness
toward the section of the American encampment
where a glimmer of light showed in the distant dugout.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll wake these fellows up and see if they’ll
let us spend the night with them,” said Hal, as they
approached the dugout.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suits me,” Chester agreed; “and if they have
any objections to our company, I’m in favor of dispossessing
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That might be rather a large order, in our present
shape,” said Hal. “However, we’ll see what they
have to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They approached the dugout and tapped lightly
on the door. There was no answer to their knock.
Hal tried again, but with the same result.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If there is anybody there, they are good
sleepers,” declared Hal. “If I don’t get an answer this
time, we’ll go in regardless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suits me,” was Chester’s response.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Hal knocked on the door and waited a
moment. There was no response from within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, here goes,” the lad declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>With that he threw open the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Inside the lads surveyed the dugout. There was
no one there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re in luck,” said Hal. “We’ll just make
ourselves at home, and if the owner objects we’ll
get out again, or put up an argument. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In that event,” said Chester, “me for the first
bunk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned in at once. Hal followed suit, making
himself as comfortable as possible in a bunk across
the little room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Outside the heavy cannonading continued without
cessation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later—it may have been 4 o’clock in
the morning—Hal was awakened by a rough hand
on his shoulder and the sound of a rough voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come up out of there,” said the voice. “This
war has reached a pretty pass when a man can’t go
out for a few minutes without somebody stealing
his bunk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal, still half asleep, sat up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the row?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the row?” repeated the man who stood
above him. “I like that. I come back to my own
little bunk, find it occupied and the occupant wants
to know what’s the row. Why shouldn’t there be a
row, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal got slowly to his feet and gazed at the man
who had thus rudely disturbed his slumber.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A marine, eh?” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” was the reply. “Lieutenant Ulysses
Smith, of the —th division. I’m obliged to you
for keeping my bed warm, but if it’s all the same to
you, I’m ready to climb in myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Smith,” said Hal, “it’s your bed. Hop in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The marine eyed the lad closely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First tell me who you are and what you are doing
here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a few words Hal recounted the adventure he
and Chester had gone through.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the marine, “I guess I don’t want
that bed after all. You need it worse than I do.
Help yourself. I’ll bunk on the floor here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no,” was Hal’s reply. “The floor is plenty
good enough for me. It’s your bed, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True enough,” said Smith, “but at the same
time, I’ve been out on a little frolic and don’t need
it half as bad as you do. So you’re a lieutenant in
the regulars, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Haven’t much to do yet, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes,” was Hal’s rejoinder. “You see, I put
in almost three years in this war before Uncle Sam
decided to get in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The marine officer looked his astonishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Hal continued, “my friend and I”—he
indicated Chester, who continued to sleep through
the conversation—“have seen active service with
most of the Allied forces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Smith held out a hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m a veteran myself,” he said. “I’ve campaigned
in the Philippines and in some of the South
American troubles. Of course, I’ve never been
mixed up in a scrap like this and I’ve a lot to learn.
I’ll appreciate anything you can tell me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a little early in the morning for a talkfest,”
said Hal with a smile, “but I’ve no doubt that when
the sun comes up and we’ve had sleep a plenty and
some good grub that I can entertain you a bit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be all ears, as my friend Jenkins would say,”
replied Smith. “Jenkins,” he explained, “is my
bunkie—Lieutenant Jenkins, by the way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess he’ll be back hunting his bed before long,”
said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shouldn’t be surprised. Guess that’s him now,”
he added, as footsteps approached without.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later a second officer in Uncle Sam’s
marine corps uniform entered the dugout.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meet my friend Lieutenant Paine, Jenkins,” said
Smith. “He dropped in rather suddenly, Fritz having
put his own bunk house out of business. I’ve
invited him and his friend to spend the night with
us. It won’t be the first time we have slept two in
a bunk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess it won’t be the last, either,” was Jenkins’
reply; “at least, not if this war lasts as long as I
figure it will. You’re a lieutenant in the regulars,
I see,” he added. “I’m afraid you’ll get a chance
sooner than we will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you’ll be in it, too,” said Hal, smiling.
“Uncle Sam is going to need every man he has over
here, and all he can send, to finish this job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, we’ll finish it, all right,” declared Jenkins.
“I’d be willing to cut ten years off my life to get a
chance at these Huns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll get it, never fear,” replied Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I don’t,” said Jenkins, “I’ll start a little war
of my own.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t pay any attention to him, Paine,” laughed
Smith. “He’s not half as bloodthirsty as he would
have you believe. But come, let’s turn in. Tomorrow
is another day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Jenkins. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later the dugout was in darkness and
only the heavy breathing of the four sleepers proclaimed
that it was inhabited.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE “DEVIL DOGS”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“So you are a couple of ‘Devil Dogs,’ eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The speaker was Chester. It was morning again
and Hal had just introduced his chum to his newly
found friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lieutenant Jenkins smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t say that,” was his reply. “Smith
and I haven’t earned the right yet to be called that.
But we are marine officers, if that’s what you
mean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s just what I mean,” said Chester. “To
tell you the truth, I never have found out just where
the marines won that name, but I know it wasn’t
bestowed without reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The name is the result of the first encounter between
American marines and Germans in the Soissons
region,” returned Lieutenant Jenkins. “I don’t
know the details of that scrap, but from all accounts
it must have been a warm one. There were
only a few of our fellows in that engagement—only
the fraction of a division. They were flanked right
and left by French and British.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The enemy came on recklessly in the face of a
heavy artillery fire. Under a rain of shells from
the German lines, the right and left wings—the
French and British—gave ground slightly. But the
marines held, and more. In the face of what seemed
utter annihilation, our fellows suddenly dashed forward.
To the enemy it must have appeared the
wildest folly. Perhaps it was. But it saved the
day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So great was the enemy’s astonishment that for
a moment his fire slackened. In that moment our
fellows were upon the Germans with the bayonet.
The enemy broke and fled, the marines in hot pursuit.
At this juncture the wings rallied and came
to our support. The Germans were driven back to
their own trenches with heavy losses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the name,” said Chester; “who was responsible
for the name, the ‘Devil Dogs’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, the name,” repeated Jenkins. “I believe the
Germans themselves were responsible for that.
After the battle, as I understand it, the German soldiers
told one another that we were ‘devils’ and
‘dogs.’ I guess someone joined the words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At all events,” laughed Hal, “you fellows have
some reputation to live up to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And we’ll live up to it, never fear,” declared
Jenkins.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so,” interposed Lieutenant Smith. “It
has often been said that the morale of the
American marines is the best in the world, and it is said
with reason. Gathered as they are from all parts
of the country, and chiefly from the rougher element,
it is only natural that they should be fighters
par excellence. The slogan that you have seen on
thousands of billboards, ‘The first to fight,’ has had
its appeal. To the true marine a fight is the salt of
life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I have always understood,” said Chester. “I
know that in times of peace the marine was considered
a bad customer. Now that he has come into
his own he is bound to give a good account of himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has always done that, no matter in what part
of the world he has been called into action,” said
Hal. “Take the troubles in Nicaragua, San Domingo,
and even at Vera Cruz, when it seemed that
we must wage war upon that country. The marines
were always first on the job, and from all accounts
they cleaned things up wonderfully well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester, “we have talked to you fellows
too long now. We’ve work to do, and I suppose
you have also. It’s time, Hal, that we reported
to Captain O’Neil. He may have something in sight
for us. We’ll see you fellows again soon, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thanks,” replied Lieutenant Smith. “I am sure
we hope so, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The four shook hands all around and Hal and
Chester a few moments later, learned to what extent
the German general staff appeared willing to go
in their efforts to drive a wedge between the French
and British lines and then execute a flanking movement
upon the French capital itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve our work cut out for us the next few
days, and possibly weeks,” the American captain
told the two lads. “Just listen to the roar of those
guns. You boys have been in this war almost four
years, but I’ll venture to say you have never heard
the like before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was true. Never, so far as Hal and Chester
could remember, had the fire of the heavy German
batteries been so terrific. The very earth quivered
under their feet from the shock. While the Allied
artillery was returning the German fire, the guns
had not been concentrated upon the foe’s positions;
but the activity of the French, British and American
artillery was soon to equal that of the enemy
and the two, combined, were speedily engaged in
what was to prove the greatest artillery action in
history.</p>

<p class='c005'>All day long and into the night the great guns
pounded on without cessation. Hastily, under the
personal direction of divisional commanders, American,
British and French troops strengthened their
positions that they might be better able to repel the
foe when the infantry advanced to the attack under
cover of the heavy German barrage.</p>

<p class='c005'>All day long and far into the night Hal and
Chester rushed hither and thither within the lines with
orders. Now, an hour after midnight, they found
themselves for the first time with nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whew!” said Hal, as he sat down on the edge of
the dugout to which they had been assigned. “This
has been the busiest day I have put in in months.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, too,” Chester agreed, “and I’ll bet a hat
that to-morrow and the days to follow will be just
as bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wouldn’t be surprised,” declared Hal. “It’s
only a matter of hours now until the Germans advance
to the attack.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester, “we’re prepared for them.
They’ll know they’ve been in a battle before they
break through here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right. The thing that I am trying to figure out
is just about how many men von Hindenburg is
willing to sacrifice in what I believe will be the last
enemy offensive on a large scale.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will cost him a terrible toll to come through
here,” declared Chester grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course. But if he really means to break
through, and the movement is not a feint to cover
an advance elsewhere, he won’t worry about the
sacrifice in human lives. He will attempt to break
through, cost what it may. If successful, he’ll
probably swing south toward Paris.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, he won’t get there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t think he will, either. But all those possibilities
must be taken into consideration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We don’t have to worry about them,” said Chester.
“I guess Marshal Foch and his staff haven’t
overlooked any such possibilities. All we’ve got to
do is what we’re told.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are, Chester. Nevertheless, we’re
free to speculate if we feel so disposed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Hal had predicted, the German attack came
soon. Under cover of the semi-darkness of early
morning, the gray-clad hosts advanced to the attack.
For miles along the long battle line, Germans
streamed from their trenches and marched slowly
toward the Allied positions only a few hundred
yards away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The enemy came on calmly and with no appearance
of haste. Machine guns from British, French
and American positions poured a hail of bullets into
the advancing ranks; but the gaps made by this fire
were immediately filled and the Germans still moved
forward, firing with monotonous regularity as they
did so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now they reached the first-line American trenches
and poured in. Desperately the Yankee troops
fought to drive them out. But, outnumbered as
they were by the enemy, they eventually were forced
to retire. This retirement was ordered primarily
so that the Americans might be kept in contact with
the French, to the north, who were forced to give
ground under the impetuous advance of the foe.</p>

<p class='c005'>All day the battle raged, first at close quarters,
and when the Allies retired farther, the big German
guns resumed the bombardment. At nightfall of
the second day it became clear to every man in the
battle that the German objective, primarily at least,
was Ypres, one of the most important towns at the
front still in possession of the Allies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still the Allies gave ground as the enemy advanced.
So, at the close of the fourth day of fighting,
the Germans had gained miles of territory and
seemed in imminent danger of encircling the city of
Ypres.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the German advance had been made at terrible
cost. Thousands upon thousands of German
dead strewed the field. In these few days of fighting
the German losses had been greater than in any
battle of the war. The losses of the Allies were
comparatively light.</p>

<p class='c005'>And still Marshal Foch withdrew his troops
slowly.</p>

<p class='c005'>It now became apparent that the commander-in-chief
of the Allied forces was ready to sacrifice
ground if he could conserve lives. Each day the
enemy advanced in the face of the terrible Allied
fire his manpower grew weaker. If these tactics
were continued, it was plain to the Allied general
staff that the enemy must slow down if for no other
reason than sheer exhaustion; at least he must slow
down until his divisions could be reorganized and
return to the fray.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each day territory won by the Germans grew
less; and then the British line before Ypres held.
It became apparent that Marshal Foch had yielded
as much ground in that section as he intended to
give up. Immediately von Hindenburg changed
his tactics and struck farther south, apparently
hoping to catch the French there by surprise. But
after an initial advance of a few miles the first day,
the French line also braced and checked the foe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again the German commander hurled his tired
troops against the British at Ypres, but this time he
failed even to dent the line. Gradually the fighting
grew less and less and soon the opposing armies settled
down quietly and only the voices of the big
guns, with occasional infantry raids, indicated that
the war was still in progress on the West front.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German gains in territory in this battle had
been large, but so had their losses. Marshal Foch
had conserved his own man-power with a genius
more than rivaling that of von Hindenburg’s strategy,
so it appeared that the advantage was with the
Allies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the second attempt of the German emperor
to carry the war to the gates of Paris had failed.
A feeling of absolute confidence ran through the
Allied army. The Germans had showed the best
they had and it was not good enough to win
through. Americans, British and French now eagerly
awaited the word that would open an offensive
by the Allies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />A RAID</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>South of the city of Ypres itself and less than
six miles east flows the river Orcuq. The crossing
of the river and the capture of the town of Dun by
the American troops will rank as one of the most
gallant feats of the operations in the Ypres sector.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this action Hal and Chester played important
roles. The troops which accomplished this work
may well rank as heroes, for their work in crossing
the stream was a strategic move of unusual daring.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crossing involved the forcing of a way over
a 160-foot stream, a half-mile stretch of mud and
a 60-foot canal in the face of a frightful enemy
fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans held the east side of the river,
hastily dug trenches less than 100 yards from the
shore making a crossing by the Allies a seemingly
impossible task.</p>

<p class='c005'>The order to cross the river came at mid-afternoon,
two days after the German offensive at Ypres
had been definitely checked. Hal and Chester
carried the order themselves. It was signed by General
Pershing, who was at the front at that moment,
and was directed to Major General Lawrence,
in command of the —st division.</p>

<p class='c005'>The troops received their instructions under a
sun which was shining for the first time in days.
The men knew almost as well as their commanders
the difficulty of the task and realized how well-nigh
impossible its accomplishment would be. Yet they
never doubted or hesitated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The orders were to send over one brigade first—and
if it failed, to send another—and others, one
after the other—if it became necessary. It was
with the dash that is traditional in the American
army that the Yankee troops tackled the problem.
Theoretically they had the choice of crossing anywhere
for five miles. Actually they were limited to
one point, where two-thirds of a mile of mud lay
between the river itself and the canal that roughly
parallels the river.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans were too firmly intrenched at all
other points. They had not protected themselves
with trenches here because they never dreamed the
Americans would be so daring as to try to force the
passage. This was a short distance north of Velliers.</p>

<p class='c005'>First came the call for swimmers from the first
brigade. Not a man who could swim a stroke failed
to stand out when the call came. Those whom their
officers thought fit were put in the van.</p>

<p class='c005'>With these went Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was intended to attack in this way on the theory
that the swimmers were less likely to be hit by the
Germans, owing to the fact that they would be
nearly submerged. On the other hand, they would
carry with them ropes and other paraphernalia for
assisting men across who were unable to swim.</p>

<p class='c005'>A perfect rain of fire from the Germans met
these first Americans, as, under command of Captain
Donaldson, Hal and Chester, they waded into
the stream. The enemy had ensconced himself up
the east bank with carefully selected machine gun
positions, which raked every point of the bank where
efforts to land could be enfiladed or met with direct
fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some men were killed in the water. More were
drowned after having been wounded, for no unwounded
man dared stop to rescue a comrade if the
maneuver were to be successful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Donaldson made no effort to keep his
men in formation as they swam rapidly across the
river. There would be time enough for formation
when they were safely ashore. Each man, when he
waded into the water, struck out for himself, his
chief aim being to reach the opposite shore as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>No bullet touched Hal or Chester as they swam
at the head of their men. Bullets kicked up the
water all about them, but both lads seemed to bear
charmed lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly a German bullet pierced the forehead of
Captain Donaldson, and the brave officer threw up
his hands and sank without a word. Instantly, realizing
that there must be a single head to the party,
Hal assumed command.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Faster, men!” he called. “We’re almost there!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The troops exerted themselves to further efforts.
Men sank every moment, hit by the enemy fire, but
the others swam on apparently utterly oblivious to
the danger that faced them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding their losses and the fact that the
swimmers could not fight back, nor even defend
themselves, the bulk of the first expedition reached
the east bank of the river with lines that were drawn
taut across the stream. Others floated on rafts and
collapsible boats. These men had less success than
the swimmers, for they were better targets for the
enemy’s fire, and the boats could be easily sunk by
bullets even if the occupants were not hit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Close to where the swimmers had crossed, engineers,
who had been drawn across, now began to
throw over pontoon bridges and a tiny foot bridge.
The pontoons crumbled under the German fire, but
the foot bridge remained intact and added materially
to the constantly increasing number of men
on the east bank. Soon after dark the first brigade
was across the first barrier and more men were
ready to make the journey.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the swimmers headed by Hal and Chester
had crossed the river, they waited eagerly until their
comrades arrived with rifles, ammunition and side
arms. Then they moved forward to the second
phase of the perilous undertaking. This was the
crossing of the kilometer of mud stretching between
the river and the canal beyond, which, though it was
under enemy fire, was not held by infantry. The
Americans stumbled across the mud under a withering
fire, firing as they advanced. From the rear
the American lines were being constantly increased,
so that now instead of the handful of men who had
forced the crossing, there were enough American
troops to offer a formidable fighting front.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their feet sank into the mud as they advanced
and soon the pace of the men was slowed down to a
laborious walk. But there was no hesitancy in the
ranks—no faltering. The men were too anxious to
come to close quarters with the foe for that. The
German guns played terrible havoc with the Yankees,
but the rest pushed through.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now came the third phase of the advance. This
constituted the crossing of the canal, with its sheer
sides and the Germans almost at the top of the eastern
bank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here again the party, led by Hal and Chester,
threw aside their arms and plunged into the water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forward men!” cried Chester, as he plunged into
the canal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men took up the cry with cheers, and swam
rapidly after him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal kept close to Chester’s side. Soon they
reached the opposite shore, where lines were again
drawn taut and other men were pulled across on
rafts and in boats.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once more the engineers got busy and almost as
if by magic, bridges appeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>Troops crossed them at the double. The bridges
stood the enemy fire bravely and troops hurried
across by hundreds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soaking wet, and with water dripping from every
garment, immediately he set foot ashore and weapons
were thrust in his hands by eager men behind,
Hal, thinking to cover the landing of those still to
come, ordered an advance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing loath, the first mere handful of men went
forward at the double.</p>

<p class='c005'>In vain the Germans, in their hastily entrenched
positions, tried to stop them with rifle and machine-gun
fire. The Americans were not to be stopped.
They had undergone too strenuous a time getting
across to be halted now.</p>

<p class='c005'>Right for the German trenches they dashed and
the enemy, his morale broken by the Yankee spirit,
offered only a half-hearted resistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>In vain the German officers tried to make their
men fight. Blows from the flat of their swords and
Teutonic imprecations failed to bring order out of
chaos as the men from Yankeeland advanced with
wild shouts and cries.</p>

<p class='c005'>Into the trenches leaped the Americans, cutting
down what few of the enemy offered resistance
there. Apparently the Germans were too bewildered
to fight with any idea of cohesion. Hundreds surrendered.
Others dropped their weapons and fled.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the west side of the canal and river fresh
American troops advanced to the support of their
comrades. General Lawrence himself crossed with
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Despite the darkness, an advance was ordered and
the American troops moved toward the village of
Dun.</p>

<p class='c005'>This little village, though exceedingly small before
the war, was now an important railway center,
and, realizing the results that could be attained if he
followed up his initial success, General Lawrence
determined to give the enemy no rest.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the distance German artillery now had taken
up the battle and shells dropped frequently in the
newly-won American positions. Nevertheless, the
Yankee troops reformed coolly enough and stood
patiently under fire until the order at last came to
advance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester, now that their part of the task
had been carried out successfully, personally reported
to General Lawrence the death of Captain
Donaldson, who had been in command of the first
crossing party.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a pity,” General Lawrence took time to say.
“He was a good officer and a brave man. I wish
both of you young men would stay by me,” he added.
“I watched you as you crossed and know that your
courage cannot be questioned. Also, I have noticed
your service stripes. My officers are few now, and
I may have need of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester clicked their heels, saluted and
stood at attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Lawrence gave his commands clearly and
quickly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The First and Second brigades were to move
upon Dun, from the west, while the Third and
Fourth, making a slight detour, were to attack from
the north. General Lawrence aimed to launch his
attack from both places simultaneously, and for this
reason the Third and Fourth brigades moved an
hour before the First and Second.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lieutenant Paine!” said General Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal approached and saluted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My compliments to Colonel Adams and order
him to move immediately with the Third and Fourth
brigades. He will attack the village from the north
an hour after daylight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal saluted again and hurried away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lieutenant Crawford!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester approached and saluted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My compliments to Colonel Gregory and order
him to attack from the front an hour after daylight.
Inform him that Colonel Adams will attack from
the north simultaneously.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester saluted and followed Hal from the general’s presence.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the heart of each lad was a great impatience,
for each longed for the action to commence. Nevertheless,
outwardly, both were perfectly cool; for
they had learned long ago and by hard experience
that in the heat of battle the things that stood them
in best stead were strong arms and cool heads.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />CAPTURE OF THE VILLAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>While the First and Second Brigades under
Colonel Gregory prepared for the early morning
attack, the Third and Fourth, under command of
Colonel Adams, marched immediately upon receiving
the instructions that Hal carried. In the natural
course of events Hal, his errand accomplished
successfully, would have returned immediately to
report to General Lawrence. In fact he had wheeled
and was about to walk away when Colonel Adams
stopped him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lieutenant,” he said, “I shall move at once in
accordance with instructions, but I would prefer
that you remain here and that one of my men reported
to General Lawrence in your stead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” was Hal’s reply, although he
could not fathom the colonel’s reasons.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Adams explained:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I lost most of my officers in the crossing of the
canal. I can use you to great advantage. By the
way, I don’t seem to recall your name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Paine, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good. Lieutenant, you will report at once
to Captain Graham, of the —th marines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He saluted and walked away. He was somewhat
surprised, for he did not know that a body of marines
had crossed the river with the infantry so recently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll bet a hat my friends Jenkins and Smith are
around some place,” he told himself as he strode
rapidly ahead.</p>

<p class='c005'>He located the body of marines with little difficulty
and reported at once to Captain Graham. As
the lad had predicted to himself, Lieutenants Smith
and Jenkins were there, and were almost the first to
see him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I see you’re on the job,” exclaimed Smith,
stepping forward as Hal left Captain Graham after
reporting and delivering his message from Colonel
Adams.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” returned Hal, “and glad to be here, particularly
so as we are about to march.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That so?” said Jenkins. “Where to?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dun,” replied Hal. “General Lawrence has determined
to push his advantage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wow!” exclaimed Jenkins. “Hear that, Smith?
Didn’t I tell you that once we got started we would
be kept on the jump?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Lieutenant Smith, who
appeared to be considerably more quiet and dignified
than his companion. “When do we start, or do you
know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Immediately,” said Hal, “and if I am not mistaken,
there is the signal now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A bugle sounded attention. The men sprang to
their places and the ranks closed in the darkness. A
moment later came the command to march.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few moments later Hal found himself in command
of a detachment at the extreme right of the
advancing column, where Captain Graham had assigned
him. Because of the unfortunate lack of
higher officers, Hal would command this detachment
during the impending engagement. A short
distance to Hal’s left Lieutenant Jenkins strode with
his men. Lieutenant Smith had been called to the
detachment that made up the left wing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Silently the American columns moved through the
darkness. The order had been passed along the line
that there must be no talking. It would be well to
advance as close to the village as possible without
being discovered by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the distance the German artillery still hurled
shells toward the American lines at infrequent intervals,
but there was nothing now in the nature of
a consistent cannonading.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours’ march brought Colonel Adams’ column
to the far edge of a small but dense wood. Beyond
could be seen a few twinkling lights in the village
of Dun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Adams called a halt. Here the Americans
would wait until an hour after daylight, at
which time Colonel Gregory would advance to the
attack from the west of the village.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hours passed slowly and the men fidgeted.
They would be cool enough when the time for action
arrived, but resting quietly in the darkness and
being allowed to utter no word, they grew restless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gradually it grew light and the men recovered
their spirits. The hour of attack was approaching
and the troops were anxious to be about their work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal glanced at his watch in the half light.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Must be about time,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>The words had hardly left his mouth when the
signal came, the shrill clear notes of a bugle sounding
a charge.</p>

<p class='c005'>A wild Yankee cheer followed the bugle call and
the Americans dashed forward at the double.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this particular section of the field there were
no trenches to be won. The German positions had
been fortified so recently that the enemy had had no
time to dig himself in. But with the warning of the
advance, the German commander rushed his men
into formation and awaited the attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>Machine guns were hurried forward and brought
into play upon the men in khaki advancing across the
open field.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the commands of their officers, the Americans
broke their close formation and scattered out,
thus making a more difficult target for the enemy.
Nevertheless, the enemy rifle and machine-gun fire
took a heavy toll in the advancing ranks.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the far left of the German line, on Hal’s right,
a machine gunner was doing fearful execution with
a gun that was hidden in a clump of trees at that
point.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove!” muttered Hal. “That fellow is tearing
things up. We’ve got to stop him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To think with Hal was to act.</p>

<p class='c005'>As his men dashed forward, he told off half a
dozen and, turning over his command to Lieutenant
Edgerton, led them sharply farther to the right.
Thus they were able to approach the clump of trees
without being exposed to the full force of the concealed
machine-gun fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bullets from other parts of the field fell among
the little party, however, and three men dropped.
Besides Hal, this now left three of the original party
of seven.</p>

<p class='c005'>The four were almost upon the little clump of
trees before the German who was hidden there with
his machine gun noticed their approach, so intent
had he been upon his other foes. When he espied
them, he turned his gun sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hail of bullets swept the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a cry to his men, Hal had thrown himself
flat upon the ground even before the German had
turned his gun in their direction, and thus Hal
escaped unscathed. Two of his men, however, were
not so fortunate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides Hal, there was now but one man able to
fight. Together he and Hal sprang to their feet and
dashed forward. Again they escaped what seemed
almost certain death by hurling themselves to the
ground. A moment later they were up and dashing
forward again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal sprang at the German machine gunner from
the left, while the remaining marine attacked him
from the right. Unable to fire effectively again, and
caught between two fires, the German rose, stepped
quickly back and produced a revolver.</p>

<p class='c005'>He took a snapshot at Hal, but the bullet went
wild.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before he could fire again, the marine was upon
him and sent him staggering back to escape a bayonet
thrust.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately the German dropped his revolver,
raising both hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kamerad!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal lowered a revolver which he had trained upon
the Boche and the marine lowered his rifle.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he did so, the German suddenly dropped his
hand to his belt, drew a second revolver and fired
point-blank at the marine. The latter side-stepped
swiftly, but although he moved promptly enough he
was not equal to the task of escaping the bullet altogether.
The ball which the German had aimed at
his heart pierced the man’s left arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the German could fire again and even before
Hal could bring his own revolver to bear, the
marine jumped forward with a roar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Treachery, eh!” he shouted. “I’ll show you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He dropped his rifle as he jumped and threw
both arms around the German. With his right
hand he pinioned the man’s left arm while he seized
his opponent’s right wrist with strong fingers.
Gradually the man’s arms described an arc until
his own revolver was pointed at his head. There
was a flash and a sharp report. The marine stepped
back and the German crumbled up on the ground.
The marine surveyed him disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kamerad, eh!” he muttered. “Well, I guess
you won’t fool anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal looked at the marine in some amazement.
The man was terribly angry and as Hal gazed at
the powerful figure he could not keep thinking that
there were few soldiers in the German army could
stand against him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come!” said Hal sharply. “Man the machine
gun there. Wheel it about and open on the enemy
to the left.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” said the marine quietly, and
followed instructions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unaware that Americans had approached so close
in this section of the field, and probably placing
reliance upon the machine gun that Hal and the
marine had just captured, the Germans exposed
themselves somewhat recklessly. Thus they were
caught in a trap when their own weapon was turned
against them.</p>

<p class='c005'>With loud cries of alarm, the enemy ranks broke
and the troops fled in utter rout. This confusion
soon spread to other detachments and the enemy
fell back upon the village.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the west, meanwhile, Colonel Gregory had
been pushing his attack as Colonel Adams’ columns
advanced. Farther back, General Lawrence was
hurrying supporting columns to the front. To the
very streets of the village the Americans pursued
the enemy, and then entered after them. From
houses and from around corners the enemy fired
upon the Yankee troops, who dashed forward with
reckless courage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gradually, however, they retired from the village
also, as their commanders realized that the American
advance could not be stopped there.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the very edge of the village Colonel Adams
halted his men. On the western outskirts, Colonel
Gregory did likewise. There they awaited orders
before advancing farther.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon the orders came.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forward!” was the cry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />IN A “BABY TANK”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>So the American advance continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>With the supporting columns of infantry that
now came forward were several score of small armored
tractors, commonly called “tanks.” Because
of the fact that these small machines, unlike their
larger counterparts, were capable of holding only
two men—a gunner and a pilot—they were called
“two-men tanks,” or more commonly, “baby tanks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As an engine of warfare, the “tank,” an American
invention primarily, had made itself famous
when General “Bingo” Byng led his British troops
forward in the Cambrai battlefield, long before the
United States entered the war. There were few
tanks in the field in those days, but since their effectiveness
was proven at Cambrai, thousands had
been added to the Allied forces.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “baby tanks” came later but proved quite as
effective. They were able to penetrate places that
were proof against their larger counter-parts, and
now there was scarcely a division of British, French
or American troops in the field that did not have its
tank corps.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the foremost American troops, among which
was Hal, now pursued the enemy, the American
“baby tanks” came waddling forward, their guns
belching fire as they advanced.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short distance beyond Dun the German general
staff, realizing that the Americans could not be
stopped in the village, had hastily thrown up a wandering
system of trenches, and to these the enemy
now retired.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately General Lawrence ordered a halt,
that he might better bring his own lines into cohesion.</p>

<p class='c005'>The American and German artillery, hastily
rushed up, continued the struggle at long distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>An hour later, Hal, returning toward his own
place in the line, accompanied by the marine who
had killed the German machine gunner, came abreast
of a “baby tank.” The tank appeared perfectly
intact, but the lad knew at a glance that there was
no crew within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder why?” he muttered, and stopped to
investigate.</p>

<p class='c005'>The small door that served as an entrance was
open. Hal peered in. The marine who was with
him also stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s the crew, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know as much about them as I do,” was
Hal’s reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe they’ve gone after ‘gas,’” said the marine.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal climbed in and examined the petrol reservoir.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Plenty of gas,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>He examined the other mechanism carefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing wrong so far as I can see,” he declared.
“However, it’s none of our business. We’ll be moving
on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But at that moment came from General Lawrence’s
portion of the field the call for a general advance.
Hal glanced around quickly. He was still
some distance from his own post, and he saw his
men start forward under command of Lieutenant
Edgerton. It was unlikely that he would be able
to overtake them. He turned to the marine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s your name?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bowers, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right. Bowers. Do you know anything
about these tanks?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much, sir. I can drive an automobile or
an airplane, and I’ve watched these things work.
Guess I could run one if I had to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you can work the gun, can’t you?” Hal
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet I can, sir, and I’ll guarantee not to
miss very often. Are you thinking of boarding this
craft, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am,” said Hal. “We seem to be out of the
fight right now. It’s up to us to get into it again.
Climb in, man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers boarded the tank with alacrity and deposited
himself beside the single machine gun. Hal
perched himself in the pilot’s seat and opened the
throttle. The tank moved forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the distance, both to right and left, Hal saw
other tanks waddling forward. They were all still
too far from the enemy to do any great damage, but
they were ambling forward as swiftly as their peculiar
construction would permit, all anxious to approach
within striking distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>In front, the American infantry, with absolute
disregard for the German artillery bombardment,
dashed for the enemy trenches. They climbed in,
and even from where Hal was the lad could see the
signs of terrible combat within.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the American charge had not been made in
sufficient force. True, the Germans were driven
from their improvised trenches, but the Yankee
forces at the extreme front were numerically too
small to pursue their advantage. They waited
quietly for the arrival of reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c005'>Straight into the erstwhile trenches the tank
driven by Hal now nosed its way. Its appearance
was received with cheers by the men. Then it waddled
crazily forward in pursuit of the foe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal was not given to unnecessary recklessness,
and the fact that he advanced now while the bulk
of the American troops remained beyond was not
due to any spirit of foolishness. In passing, Hal
was not aware of the fact that the most advanced
troops were awaiting reinforcements. He thought
that they would continue the pursuit at once. Therefore,
in spite of the cries to stop that were raised
behind, the tank ambled on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, so suddenly that it seemed that a curtain of
blackness had been thrown about them, a fog descended
over the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the advance of the tank, the German artillery
and machine guns had been busy. A mine or two
had exploded near the machine. Hal had been
struck in the left hand by a tiny bit of shrapnel
that found its way through one of the loopholes,
but so slightly that the skin had only been bruised.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal put the snout of the tank over the edge of a
hill in the fog, but stopped in time to keep from
end-over-ending down. Then he felt his way carefully
down hill by a roundabout road.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the valley beyond there were machine gun
nests and one seventy-seven field piece and some
wandering trenches. In the hillside overhead were
scores of burrow-like dugouts in which Germans had
fortified themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this direction Hal still guided his tank, confident
that the American forces also were advancing
under cover of the fog.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the thousand shattering noises of battle,
the approach of the tank had not been noticed. Suddenly
the fog lifted, and for the first time Hal was
conscious of the fact that his baby tank was unsupported
by other tanks, or infantry, although the
big American guns still sounded from behind.
Nevertheless, Hal knew that the American advance
was likely to be resumed at any minute.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of the lifting of the fog, the approach of
the tank was still unperceived by the enemy. It is a
constant source of wonder to tank crews that this
happens so often. Locked up in their steel chamber
and with a hammering gun they feel their roaring
progress must herald them afar. Yet it often happens
that they creep upon the enemy as though their
beast had been shod with velvet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal saw the flare of the “77” and headed toward
it. Bowers turned a stream of fire on it and the
gun went out of action.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tank lurched on toward a long windrow of
rusted wire. The wire shone red in the sun that
had come out to dispel the fog. In successive alterations
of the defense, it had been made into a pile
fifty feet long, by twenty broad, and four feet high.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks like a machine-gun nest to me!” called
Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Hal still guided the machine toward the spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly a veritable hail of bullets poured upon
the tank and rattled harmlessly off the steel sides.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal stopped the tank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re right,” he called to Bowers. “It’s a nest,
all right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For the next ten minutes, as Hal expressed it
later, “we just sat there and took it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An anti-tank rifle was brought into play by the
Germans. This weapon was a monster indeed, fully
seven feet long and forty pounds in weight—not,
perhaps, a monster as compared with heavy siege
guns and heavy artillery, but a mammoth for an
anti-tank gun. But the anti-tank’s rifle bullets likewise
failed to pierce the living-room of the tank,
although they did cut through the running gear in
one or two spots that were not vital.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Bowers ducked down so that they would
not be struck by slivers should they come through
the eye-slits in the tank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re in a tight place, sir,” called Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” Hal agreed. “We don’t want to take
too many chances peeking through the eye-holes
while those bullets are hitting around us like this.
Great Scott! Listen! It sounds like someone was
hitting the skin with a sledge hammer at the rate of
fifty blows a second.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sliver suddenly spun through a porthole and
struck Bowers on the hand. The wound was slight
but painful. Bowers wrung his numbed hand in
silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurt much?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir. I’ll be all right in a second.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the hand wasn’t all right in a second. It was
still too numb to permit of handling the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There isn’t any use of our being here unless we
can do some good,” Hal called. “I’m afraid you
can’t work that gun any longer, Bowers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can drive,” was Bowers’ reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the two changed places, Hal going into the
gunners turret.</p>

<p class='c005'>This to Hal was one of the worst moments of the
battle, for tankers fit as closely into tanks as snails
in their shells. It was with an effort that Hal and
Bowers crawled past each other, for there were several
painful moments when two bodies occupied the
space that was a tight fit for one. But they managed
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers waggled the tank out into the open and
headed for the nest of annoying gunners, and Hal
will always have respect for these gunners.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of their failure against the tank, the
Prussians died with their hands on their guns. Others
ran away and the tank was checked in its progress,
while Hal poured volley after volley at the fleeing
foes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Hal was arrested by a shout from Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey! What’s that?” cried the marine.</p>

<p class='c005'>Looking a trifle to the left, Hal saw four Germans
wearing Red Cross uniforms, carrying something
on a litter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s a mighty funny-looking stretcher,” said
Bowers. “Have a shot at it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a chance,” replied Hal. “They’re Red Cross
workers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s a funny-looking litter,” said Bowers, unconvinced.
“Take my advice and shoot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, suddenly, without further words, Hal
turned his gun on the four men, in spite of their
Red Cross uniforms, and fired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And just in time!” muttered Bowers to himself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE ADVANCE CONTINUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The queer-looking litter, as Bowers termed it,
came suddenly to life.</p>

<p class='c005'>The quartet of Germans tumbled in a sprawling,
jerking heap. One sprang in the air, raising and
overturning the litter as he did so. The gray blanket
which had covered it fell off and Bowers’ suspicions
were confirmed. It was a machine gun the
“Red Cross” counterfeits had been carrying away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good job there, sir,” Bowers called to Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad nodded grimly to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So that’s the way they play the game, eh?” he
said. “Well, I’ll be prepared for them when they
try another trick like that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The tank jangled on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Out of a hole in the ground, partially hidden by
a tangle of old wire, suddenly popped a German boy
in soldier’s uniform. His appearance was so unexpected
that Bowers stopped the tank abruptly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German’s hands were raised high in the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kamerad!” he cried. “Kamerad!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He was so near the tank that Hal could see the
tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t got the heart to shoot him,” Bowers
called to Hal. “Climb out, sir, and see what he has
to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal knew as well as any soldier in the Allied armies
that tanks, British, French or American, were
not expected to make prisoners unless the infantry
was in immediate support, and for this reason he understood
what Bowers meant when the marine said
he couldn’t shoot the German boy down in cold
blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The reason may be readily understood, for the
crew of a baby tank is composed of only two men.
Only now and then is it possible to shepherd prisoners
ahead of a tank and it is always bad practice
for either of the crew to leave his steel fortalice. In
this case, however, Hal took into consideration the
youth of the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better be careful, sir,” Bowers called as Hal
opened the door and crawled out. “Remember the
Boche who called ‘Kamerad’ to me awhile back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But this is only a boy,” replied Hal, “and he’s
crying at that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can’t help that, sir. They’re all bad actors and
none is to be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess I’m safe enough,” declared Hal, as he
advanced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Got your gun?” called Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t need any gun for this Boche,” said he.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe not,” grumbled Bowers to himself, “but
I guess I’ll just crawl out after you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Hal approached the boy, the German’s face
changed. He saw that Hal was unarmed, while at
his side hung a handsome Luger pistol. He stopped
his cry of “Kamerad” and began jerking at the
fastenings of his weapon. The flap of the American
holster fastens with a leather button, which facilitates
hasty action, while the German holster is buckled
down.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the German could get the buckle unloosed,
Hal had him by the throat. The German fought in
despairing silence now, one hand plucking at the
fingers that were choking him and the other still
fumbling with the gun. At this juncture Bowers,
also unarmed, closed in.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of his youth, the German was of powerful
build and he struggled so furiously that for a
moment Hal and Bowers were unable to quiet him.
In the struggle, Bowers caught sight of a long, thin
stiletto which the German wore at his left side. His
right hand shot out and clasped the handle. The
weapon flashed aloft.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold on!” cried Hal. “He’s only a kid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers caught himself just in time. With a
mumbled imprecation, he cast the stiletto away from
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good thing you yelled,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal had now possessed himself of both the German’s
hands and his adversary was unable to fight
further. Nevertheless, the struggle would have been
at a deadlock had it not been for Bowers, who now
approached and relieved the German of his pistol.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, you can let him go now, sir,” the marine
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal released his hold and stepped back, at the
same time covering the German with the Luger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sit down,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is doubtful if the young German understood
Bowers’ words, but he certainly caught their import,
for he sat down in front of the tank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers turned to Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see, they’re all alike, sir,” he said. “They’re
not to be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I see.” said Hal. “Well, I won’t be caught
napping again. And this is the second one that has
tried that ‘Kamerad’ trick on us in the same day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Almost within the same hour, you might say,”
replied Bowers. “But what are we going to do with
him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s a hard question,” was Hal’s reply. “We
can’t make him prisoner and I’m not disposed to let
him go scott-free in view of his actions. Guess we
might as well tie him up and leave him here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suits me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A few moments later the German was lying on
the ground, his hands bound with portions of his
own clothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess he won’t bother about yelling ‘Kamerad’
again,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, we’re all here,” said Bowers with a smile.
“So where do we go from here, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment, far back, came the crash of infantry
fire. Turning, Hal and Bowers perceived
the foremost line of advancing Americans in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wow!” cried Bowers, and his trench helmet
went sailing high in the air. “Here they come, sir.
Don’t they look fine?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet they do, Bowers,” Hal shouted, carried
away by his own enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, it was an inspiring sight, the long line of
khaki-clad figures which came sweeping forward at
a slow run.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll come up to us presently. All we have to
do is wait,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The long line came directly toward them. At the
pace they were advancing they would reach Hal,
Bowers and their tank in fifteen minutes. But suddenly
the formation of the charging troops changed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey!” cried Bowers. “They’re not coming
this way after all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It appeared to be true.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still quite a distance away, the American infantry
had wheeled sharply to the right.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Flank attack,” said Hal briefly, “but it leaves us
high and dry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Bowers, “I’ve heard that these contraptions,”
referring to the tank, “carry signal
flags.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll hoist one,” said Hal briefly. “They may
see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He climbed back into the tank, reappearing
shortly with a small flag which he ran up on the
turret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now all we can do is sit down and wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And pray that the Germans don’t arrive in force
first,” Bowers added dryly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two sat down in the sunlight and followed
the course of the battle in the distance. Gradually
the American charge slowed down. From beyond,
Hal could see the ranks of the gray-clad hosts as
they emerged from the German lines farther back
to charge the American infantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll get all the fight they want,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And more,” agreed Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Directly Hal caught the roar of wings coming toward
them. He glanced aloft. An American liaison
plane was approaching.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers let out a cheer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The aeroplane approached close enough to see the
signal on the turret of the tank, and signalled back
that reinforcements would be sent. Then it flew
away again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In which case,” said Hal, “we might as well get
busy again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My sentiments, sir,” agreed Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>They re-entered the tank, leaving their prisoner
still tied on the ground. The young German eyed
them angrily as they disappeared within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Machine gun nest to the right, Bowers,” called
Hal, who again manned the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without further words, Bowers headed the tank
in that direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’re firing explosive bullets, sir,” called Bowers
coolly a few moments later as the earth flew
high to one side of the tank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Previous to this, the use of explosive bullets
against tanks had been questioned, but Hal was
bound to believe the evidence of his own eyes. In
the instance where the use of explosive bullets had
been reported before, they had been effective in that
they had set fire to gasoline in the travel tanks
lashed to the machine’s sides. Hal, recalling the details
of that battle, was thankful that there were no
tanks of gasoline lashed to the tank in which he
and Bowers were confined.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, it seemed to Hal and Bowers, they were in
the center of a group of machine-gun nests. Hal
fired as rapidly as he could bring his gun to bear.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Germans had developed wisdom. The
machine gunners crouched down in their holes
whenever the tanks were turned on them, and let
gunners in other nests take up the fight. A surprising
number of machine-guns were developed around
the tank. Evidently the gunners had kept under
cover during the previous activities of the tank and
only popped up when it seemed safe.</p>

<p class='c005'>It began to grow uncomfortably hot in the tank.
The backplace which separated the engine compartment
from the turret and steering room became almost red hot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s eyes grew dim as he tried to bring the tank’s
gun to bear on the enemy. He felt his senses leaving
him, and his clothes began to scorch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s go,” he called to Bowers. “I’m through.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They jerked open the little door in the tank nose
through which men rise in jack-in-the-box fashion
and hurled themselves out. They struck the ground
upon all fours, but picked themselves up and ran.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through all the noise of battle that now was
drawing closer to them they heard the machine-gun
bullets twanging above their heads. In the distance
was a bit of ruined wall. Directly they gained its
shelter. Before leaving the tank they had seized
their revolvers. These they now carried in their
hands. The German infantry bore down on them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re in a bad way, Bowers,” said Hal quietly.
“What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers tapped his revolver, affectionately it
seemed to Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve got our gats!” he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />CHESTER TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Despite himself, Hal was forced to smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Gats?’” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, that’s what we call ’em on the East Side
in good old New York,” replied Bowers, also smiling.
“But you can call ’em anything you want to.
We ought to be good for a couple of Huns apiece
before we go down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll know we’re here, at all events,” declared
Hal grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the Germans bore down on them from the
east, Hal glanced quickly over his shoulder and
uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here come the Yanks!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was true. Half a mile behind them a long line
of the boys in khaki advanced at the double, spread
out in the battle formation which had its origination
in the great war. Behind the first line came a second
and then a third.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal estimated the distance with a practiced eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Half a mile,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Bowers, “and the Germans are a
quarter of a mile closer—but still not close enough
for my little gun here. But if there is going to be
a race for us, I’ll lay long odds on Fritz.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks like you’d win,” replied Hal. “There is
the first messenger,” he added quietly, as a German
bullet struck the wall behind which the two had
taken refuge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers peered over the top of the wall, raised his
automatic and would have fired had Hal not stayed
his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t waste your bullets,” said the lad. “Remember
the watchword of the battle of Bunker Hill:
‘Wait until you see the whites of their eyes.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Bowers briefly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came a volley of bullets from the foremost Germans
as Hal and the marine crouched down behind
their refuge. The bullets flattened themselves
against the stout wall, but did no other damage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pure waste of ammunition,” was Hal’s cool comment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do the fools want to shoot for?” demanded
Bowers. “All they have to do is rush us.
We’ll probably get a couple of them, but they are
bound to get us in the end.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It appeared that the German officers had reached
the same conclusion, for the rifle fire of the advancing
infantry ceased and the Germans came on with
fixed bayonets.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s where the Marine Corps loses a private
of the first class,” said Bowers, with something like
a grin, as he made sure that his automatic was ready
for business.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks like a certain lieutenant was going along
with you,” replied Hal, again glancing over his
shoulder and calculating the distance to the approaching
American forces. “Well, they’ve seen
us anyhow,” he added.</p>

<p class='c005'>There came a shout of encouragement from the
Yankee line and the troops appeared to redouble
their speed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Help on the way, sir,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the Germans are here,” rejoined Hal.
“Don’t waste a shot, Bowers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wear a marksman’s medal, sir,” replied Bowers
simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans still came forward with a rush.
Hal and Bowers stood to the wall, their revolvers
poked slightly above and beyond it.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this position, both were exposed to rifle fire
from the enemy, but if they intended to fight back
and not be caught like rats in a trap there was no
help for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Crack!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s revolver spoke first and a German toppled
in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers’ automatic belched forth a stream of fire
as he swept the German line. At this distance, a
miss was practically impossible. Thus ten shots
were hurled among the advancing foes and every
bullet found its mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some shooting, Bowers,” said Hal quietly, as
he emptied his revolver into the very faces of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no time to reload.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal clubbed his revolver in his right hand and
waited. Bowers did likewise. Neither thought of
surrender. In fact, so inhuman and barbarous had
been the action of the Germans in the past that it
was doubtful whether they would be spared should
they raise their hands high in the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here they come!” cried Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first German to poke his head around the
wall from the left tumbled back again as the butt
of Bowers’ revolver crashed down on his skull.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fortunately for the two, the granite wall, at the
extreme right, touched a steep hill, thus preventing
a surrounding movement by the enemy. Nevertheless,
it was possible that the enemy might climb the
hill and pick Hal and Bowers off with revolver or
rifle at will. On the other hand, there was little
likelihood that they would have time for such a
maneuver before the American troops reached the
spot. Besides the left flank, therefore, the only way
the foe could reach the defenders was over the wall
itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>One German tried this. Climbing to the top of
the wall, he leaped down. As he struck the ground
Hal’s revolver crashed down on his head and he lay
still.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later two Germans leaped down together.
The first Hal met with a blow to the head
with his revolver, but before he could turn, the second
man seized him in a powerful embrace. Hal
kicked out with his left foot, which found the German’s
shin. At the same time the lad sent his left
fist into the man’s face. Down went the German.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers, meanwhile, was equally hard pressed.
Two men he disposed of with his revolver butt and
his fists; then the enemy surrounded him. Hal,
thinking to join forces with the marine, had moved
backward as other enemies came over the wall and
just before Bowers was hemmed in, the two managed
to get back to back.</p>

<p class='c005'>American arms flew about like flails and wherever
a fist or a revolver butt landed, a German
crashed to earth. Right and left Hal and Bowers
struck out until their arms grew weary.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the press of conflict, it seemed impossible that
the two could remain on their feet. The struggle
would have ended almost as soon as it began had
one of the enemy been able to bring a revolver or
rifle to bear, but so close were the struggling figures
that the Germans could not fire without imminent
risk of killing one of their own number.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the struggle went on.</p>

<p class='c005'>But an unequal combat such as this could have
but one ending. Under the overwhelming numbers
that closed in on them, Hal suddenly went down.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a bellow like that of an enraged bull, Bowers
moved back a trifle and stood squarely over the
lad, one foot on each side of his prostrate form.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two Germans jumped him from in front and two
from behind. The first he sent staggering with a
powerful blow from his right fist. The second he
hurled from him with a kick; then turned on his
heel to face the men behind. One of these threw
his arms around Bowers’ neck. Without a moment’s
hesitation, the marine buried his teeth in the
man’s hand and the strangle hold relaxed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whirling about, Bowers caught the fourth man
in his arms, picked him up as though he had been a
child and tossed him squarely in the faces of his
comrades. Then, single-handed, he charged his foes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rifles were raised by the German soldiers and
brought down sharply. Bowers reeled back, made
an effort to retain his feet, and then sank to the
ground unconscious.</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost at the same moment, and as a German
infantryman raised his bayonet to finish his work,
a hail of rifle fire swept the Boche troops. Followed
a loud Yankee cheer and the first American troops
entered the conflict.</p>

<p class='c005'>So intent had the enemy been on finishing Hal and
Bowers, that they seem to have paid little attention
to the advancing American columns. It is probable
that they had been ordered to finish the work in
hand before worrying about the others and this had
taken so long that they were caught in their own
trap.</p>

<p class='c005'>With cries of terror, the Germans gave ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>But even as they turned to flee, the Americans
were upon them with swords and bayonets. Foremost
in the advancing columns, their swords throwing
circles of steel about their heads and revolvers
clasped in their left hands, belching fire, three officers
dashed forward. Two were marines. The
other wore the garb of the regular army. The first
two were Lieutenants Smith and Jenkins; the third,
Chester Crawford.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get ’em, Smith!” shouted Jenkins. “You may
not get another chance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Smith apparently needed no urging. He led his
men on with wild cries. In the face of these charging
demons the Germans, who at first had attempted
to retire with some semblance of order, broke and
fled in utter rout. With loud cheers, the boys from
Yankeeland followed close on their heels.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Lieutenant Smith, who was slightly
ahead of Jenkins and Chester, halted. He had come
upon the prostrate forms of Hal and Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello!” he ejaculated, paying no heed to the confusion
of battle. “A marine, and he is down. Fritz
will have to pay for that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He sprang forward again.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later Chester came upon his fallen
chum. There was fear in his heart as he bent over
Hal, but this quickly fled as Hal drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester lifted Hal to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still alive, eh?” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alive and kicking,” replied Hal briefly. “Give
me a gun or something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’d better——” Chester began.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Hal stooped quickly, picked up a fallen German’s
rifle and sprang forward. Chester darted
after him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers, meanwhile, also had come to his senses
and was endeavoring to get to his feet. A company
of marines, moving rapidly forward, encircled him,
steadied him and he also was given a rifle. The
marines, closely followed by regular army troops,
continued the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal turned to Chester as they ran ahead, trying
to catch up with the first-line troops, who by this
time were some distance ahead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the nick of time again, old man,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was afraid I wouldn’t be,” was Chester’s reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ahead, the American advance suddenly slowed
down. The reason was soon clear. German reinforcements
had been rushed hurriedly forward, and
the enemy was making a stand. But the Yankee halt
was only momentary.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forward!” came the command.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE ENEMY ROUTED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The engagement into which American troops and
American marines now entered bore more resemblance
to old-time open fighting than anything Hal
and Chester had seen in months.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short distance ahead, the German line had
halted and drawn up in close battle formation.
Upon this human rock the Yankees hurled themselves
with reckless abandon and wild cheers. One,
two, three volleys they fired at the Germans as they
charged and then they were upon the enemy with
the bayonet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German line withstood the first onrush and
the Americans were stopped. But in spite of their
losses, they were not to be denied, and they dashed
forward again.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time Hal and Chester had reached the
ranks in front and pressed into the thick of the conflict.
A few moments later Bowers ranged himself
alongside of them. The lads greeted him with a
nod; they had no time for words.</p>

<p class='c005'>So close were the American soldiers together that
for the space of a few moments it was impossible
for them to wield their bayonets with the greatest
effect. All they could do was to press ahead with
the bayonets shoved out in front of them. But this
condition was soon remedied. The men spread out
fanwise, thus giving them better opportunity for
using their weapons.</p>

<p class='c005'>The clash of the bayonets could be heard above
the roar of small arm fire and even above the cheering
of the Yankees. For their part, the Germans
fought silently and stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal caught the point of a stabbing bayonet upon
his own weapon and averted the thrust that otherwise
must have pierced his throat. Before the German
who had delivered it could recover his poise,
Hal’s bayonet had found its mark and the man fell
to the ground to rise no more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester, meanwhile, had accounted for two of the
enemy and had not been touched himself. Bowers,
once more in the heat of the conflict, was fighting
like a superman, thrusting right and left with almost
miraculous rapidity.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German line wavered along its entire length.
The Americans, unconsciously feeling that victory
was within their grasp, pressed forward with even
greater ferocity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly, to Hal’s right, fully fifty Germans
threw down their guns as a single man, and, raising
their hands high above their heads, shouted “Kamerad”
almost in unison.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately these men were surrounded, their
weapons collected and the Germans passed back to
the rear ranks as prisoners. Following their action,
other groups of Germans, separated from their comrades,
followed the example of the first batch. For
a moment it appeared as if the entire line in action
would surrender.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under harsh commands of their officers, however,
the German line regained something of its cohesion
and began a more orderly retreat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still the Americans pressed close on their heels.
After a few moments of ineffectually attempting to
hold back the Americans while retreating orderly,
the German line broke again and the German soldiers
fled.</p>

<p class='c005'>It now became a case of each man for himself.
With a cry to a score of troopers who had gathered
about him, Hal dashed forward, thinking to take
another batch of prisoners. But this particular
group of the foes showed an unexpected burst of
speed and the Americans were unable to overtake
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the distance, the German artillery again
burst into action and shells fell dangerously close
to Hal’s little detachment. In front of him, Hal
saw half a dozen of the enemy go down before the
fire of their own guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately the lad called a halt, and then led
his men back to the supporting columns which had
come to a pause. Farther back, the American artillery,
which had been silent while the hand-to-hand
struggle raged, became active again. The hour
of infantry fighting had passed and the big guns
took up the battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hastily the Americans fell to work with intrenching
tools to make secure their newly-won positions
against a possible German attack. Only a thin line
of skirmishers stood to their rifles to repel any attack
that might develop while the digging in was
in progress.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal found Chester with the marine, Bowers, a
short distance back of the first line.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Glad you’re both safe,” he said as he walked up
to them. “Fortunately I was not even touched.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor I,” said Chester, “but our marine friend
here didn’t fare quite so well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That so?” said Hal, turning to Bowers.
“Where are you wounded?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the left shoulder,” answered the marine, “but
it’s just a scratch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless, you had better report and have it
attended to at once,” advised Hal. “Complications
are likely to develop, you know, and we can’t afford
to lose a man unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” said Bowers. “I shall heed your
advice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He saluted, turned on his heel and walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A good man, Chester,” said Hal. “He and I
went through rather a ticklish bit of work and he
certainly upheld the traditions of the marines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That so?” said Chester. “How did you happen
to get so well acquainted with him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a few words Hal explained, and added:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now give me an account of your troubles since
I saw you last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester with a laugh, “you seem to
have had all the fun. In my case there isn’t much
to tell. I lost sight of you soon after the advance
began and before long found myself in the midst
of the fighting. I had a couple of narrow escapes in
the course of the battle and I guess I got in a couple
of good licks. Then, when we halted the first time,
I hunted around for you, but you were missing. I
was able to learn, however, that you had gone off
on a little jaunt to put a certain machine gun out of
action, but that’s all I could learn. I began to fear
you had been killed. But when we came in sight of
two men holding that little wall in face of the entire
German army, it seemed, I told myself, that it
was you. Events have proved that I was right.
Then I came on as fast as I could, Smith and Jenkins
with me. That’s about all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “I’ve had about enough excitement
for one day. I vote we report to General
Lawrence, who I see has moved his quarters close
to the front. After that, unless there is work in
store for us, I am in favor of finding a place to take
a little nap.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suits me,” agreed Chester. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But, as it developed, there was to be no sleep for
either Hal or Chester for hours to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Lawrence received the reports of the two
lads in silence and for some moments seemed
wrapped in thought. At last he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have done very well, young men. You will
not think I am imposing upon you when I ask
whether you are willing to take despatches for me
to General Pershing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, sir,” said Hal. “We shall be very
glad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Lawrence took a sheaf of papers from
his pocket and passed them to Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These must be delivered to General Pershing
with all possible haste,” he said. “In a high-powered
automobile, you should be able to reach his
quarters soon after dark. It is probable that you
will be ordered back here at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He indicated that the interview was at an end.
Hal and Chester saluted and took their departure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later they were speeding westward
in a big army automobile, Hal himself at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you ask me, Chester,” said Hal as they sped
along, “these marines, from what I have seen of
them, are going to prove among the most effective
units in Uncle Sam’s army.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What makes you think so?” demanded Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, take this man Bowers for example. Of
course, he’s a powerful man, but it’s his spirit that
counts—he’s afraid of nothing. He’s perfectly cool
under fire and when it comes to hand-to-hand fighting
I doubt if there’s a man in the German army
who could stand up against him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s only one,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s true enough. But look at the rest of
them—rough and ready every one. Hard men they
are. Most of them look as though they had come
off the Bowery in New York, or were prize fighters,
or gun-men. They are bound to give a good account
of themselves in a fight. Hardly a marine
who doesn’t look as though he had been brought up
to fight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess most of them have,” replied Chester
dryly. “They gave a good account of themselves
to-day, as far as that goes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So they did,” agreed Hal, “but their numbers
were comparatively small. Take a couple of divisions
now, and I’ll venture that they could drive
back twice their number.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s a pretty fair-sized order, Hal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it is, but that’s just what I think.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll have need of
men like that. But look! we seem to be coming to
some place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll stop and make sure of our bearings,” said
Hal, and brought the car to a stop before a group
of French soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the benefit of the reader, it may be said that
up to this time, the American troops had not been
acting independently of their British and French
allies. Up to this time there was no distinct American
army in the field. American troops had been
brigaded with French and British divisions for
seasoning purposes, for the Allied staff could not
understand how raw troops could possibly hold their
own against the Germans without having been put
through a rigorous course of training with veteran
troops.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet British and French alike soon were to
learn the true mettle of American troops, whether
fully trained or not. They were to learn that wherever
an American soldier was ordered he went, or
died in the effort.</p>

<p class='c005'>The date was not now far distant when this was
to be brought home to the British and French in a
manner they will never forget and, as it developed,
it was the American marines who were to prove it;
for at the battle of Chateau Thierry the American
marine was to prove that as a fighting man there
does not live his equal.</p>

<p class='c005'>From a French officer, Hal gained needed
directions and the big army auto continued its journey.
Darkness fell and they still sped on. At eight
o’clock Hal stopped the machine in the center of a
big army camp and stepped out. He made his way
to General Pershing’s quarters. Chester went with
him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />A FRIEND IN NEED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A voice, strangely familiar to Hal and Chester,
floated into the American trenches from the darkness
of No Man’s Land beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello,” said Captain O’Neil, “somebody left out
there, eh? Well, I guess he’ll have to make the best
of it for the night. Fritz is in an ugly humor this
evening. No use stirring him up. We’re pretty
comfortable here for a change.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seems pretty tough to leave him out there
though, sir,” Chester ventured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it does. Still when he came into this war he
must have known it wasn’t a game of tiddlewinks.
He’ll have to take his chances same as the rest of
us. Anyhow, he’s probably in a shell hole and
should be safe enough. But I thought all our men
returned safely after the raid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought so, too, sir,” said Hal. “There wasn’t
a man reported missing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Probably a straggler from another brigade, sir,”
said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Most likely,” rejoined Captain O’Neil. “We’ll
see what can be done for him in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He strode away.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was two days after Hal and Chester had delivered
General Lawrence’s despatches to General
Pershing. Contrary to their expectations, they had
not been ordered to return again to General Lawrence’s
command, but had been returned to their
own division, which at that time chanced to be
guarding front-line trenches in the Soissons region
only a short distance south of the Marne. Arrived,
they had reported at once to Captain O’Neil and
had been assigned new quarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>To-night they were keeping watch. Early in the
evening they had accompanied a party of troops
in a raid on a certain point in one of the German
trenches. Several prisoners had been made and the
Americans had not lost a man. It was no wonder,
then, that they should be surprised at the voice
which called from No Man’s Land.</p>

<p class='c005'>The voice came again:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove, Hal!” said Chester, “there is something
familiar about that voice. Wonder who it can be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shrugged his shoulders, a habit occasioned
by long association with French troops.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t know,” was his reply; “but I’ll admit I
seem to have heard it before. We’ll see when daylight
comes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment a private by the name of
McHugh began to sing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where do we go from here, boys, where do we
go from here?” were the words of the song that
broke the uncanny stillness of the trenches. It was
the song that had come into fame after the American
troops reached the battlefields of France—the
song to which American regiments marched into
battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other voices took up the song.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came a hail in broken English from the German
trenches scarce a hundred yards away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey there, Yanks!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly the singing in the American trenches
came to a stop.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want, Fritz?” Hal called back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make so much noise, all you fellows, and
let the boy sing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy, Chester took it, was McHugh. He
could not have been more than twenty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has a grand voice,” the German continued.
“If he will sing us a song we will let the man in
the shell hole oud there go back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time the voice from No Man’s Land
cried a third time:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester took counsel with Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” he said, “shall we take Fritz at his
word?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It should be explained here that incidents such as
this were not uncommon in the trenches where
friend and foe were so close together. More than
once British and American soldiers had shared their
tobacco and other luxuries with the less fortunate
Germans. Sometimes, conversations like this were
carried on for hours at a time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trouble is,” Hal answered Chester, “you can’t
trust them. It’s likely to be a ruse to get the man
into the open so they can take a shot at him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And it may be they’re acting in good faith this
time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, it may be, of course.” Hal turned to the
private. “What do you say, McHugh, will you sing
for Fritz?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said McHugh, “I didn’t enlist to come
over here and entertain the Boche, but if it’ll do that
chap out there any good, why count me in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good,” said Hal. He raised his voice.
“Still there, Fritz?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yah! What have you decided?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’ll sing for you. But we’ll hold you to your
word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good,” said the German. “Let him stand up
on the top of the trench so we can see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no you don’t, Fritz,” Hal shouted back.
“We’re on to your tricks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it is no trick,” the German protested. “We
give our words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your word is not always to be trusted, Fritz.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But me,” said the voice. “I am Hans Loeder,
who sang on the American stage. I give the word
of an artist.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove, sir!” ejaculated McHugh at this juncture.
“I know him well. In Chicago I once took
lessons from him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So?” exclaimed Hal in surprise. “Then maybe
you would wish to talk to him. But remember he
is a German, after all, and be careful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello there, professor!” called McHugh.
“Don’t you remember me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vat?” came the reply. “Can it be my old pupil
Daniel McHugh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The same, professor,” McHugh shouted back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No wonder I recognize the voice,” came the response.
“Did I not say always that you had talent?
And now you will sing for us, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure,” said McHugh. “I’ll take your word,
professor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Without further words, the young soldier sprang
to the top of the trench.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “if you’re going up, so am I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He sprang up also, and Chester followed suit.
A moment later fully a hundred American heads appeared
over the top of the trenches. Beyond, in
the darkness, German heads also bobbed up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now professor,” said McHugh, “what shall it
be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Someding lively,” was the reply. “Someding to
make us forget why we are here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Darktown Colored Ball,” suggested McHugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yah!” came the cry from the German lines.
“Dat is id. Someding with the swing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So McHugh sang. And when he concluded, a
hail of applause came from the enemy lines. The
American troops also applauded and cheered. Two
more popular songs McHugh sang and then, when
the applause had died down, he called out:</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all for to-night, professor. More some
other time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good,” was the shouted reply. “Now I keep my
word. Tell your friend oud there he may return
without fear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on in, you out there,” cried one of the
Yankee soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no,” the man in the shell hole shouted back.
“They just want to get me out there for a little target
practice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rats!” shouted McHugh. “Crawl out of there
and come in like a man. We’re here to protect you
if we have to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You haven’t done much of a job of it so far,”
said the voice from No Man’s Land.</p>

<p class='c005'>A German voice broke in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can have but ten minutes,” it said. “After
that you must take your chances.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fair enough, Fritz,” called an American. “Hey!
You in the shell hole, come on in here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s safer here,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again a German voice interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the Yank is afraid,” it said, “we will allow
two of your number to go and get him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Half a dozen men would have leaped from the
trench had Hal not stayed them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You stay here and cover us,” he said. “Lieutenant
Crawford and I will go. At the first sign of
treachery, fire without hesitation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” said Private McHugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester leaped down and advanced into
the darkness of No Man’s Land.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No use coming after me now,” cried the voice
in the shell hole. “I know when I’m well off. I
don’t want to be shot in the back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott, Chester!” he cried. “Haven’t you
recognized that voice yet?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” returned Chester in some surprise. “Have
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rather,” said Hal dryly. “It’s Stubbs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester clapped a hand on his leg.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By all that’s wonderful!” he exclaimed. “Now
why couldn’t I place that voice?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads increased their pace and at length they
came to the shell crater where the lone American
had taken shelter from the German fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on out of there,” said Hal, disguising his
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much,” said the man inside.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be a fool, man,” said Chester angrily.
“We’ve only a few moments’ grace. Hurry, now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say,” came the voice from the darkness, “why
are you fellows bent on getting me killed? I haven’t
done anything to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to hurry, Hal,” said Chester. “Let’s
go down and get him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The two lads leaped into the shell crater and laid
rough hands upon the occupant, who squirmed and
struggled in vain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me go,” he cried angrily, and struck out
right and left.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen, Stubbs,” said Hal. “If you don’t come
out of here right now I’ll have to tap you over the
head with my revolver.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The struggles of the man in the shell hole ceased.
He almost moaned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal!” he gasped, and muttered to himself.
“Anthony, you certainly are out of luck. Something
always happens. And I suppose Chester is here, too,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor Stubbs,” said the occupant of the hole.
“You’re a dead man!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />STUBBS EXPLAINS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Come along, Stubbs,” said Chester. “Time is
growing short. Fritz is likely to open fire most any
minute.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the first shot is sure to hit me,” said Stubbs.
“Well, I can run if I have to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He sprang out of the shell crater as he spoke and
made for the American lines at full speed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess we might as well do a little sprint ourselves,”
said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two lads dashed after Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stubbs was surrounded by a crowd of soldiers
when Hal and Chester clambered into the trenches.
There was amazement on the faces of most of the
men at the fact that a man should appear from No
Man’s Land and not be attired in uniform; for
Stubbs wore only a plain khaki suit, cut after the
fashion of military garments, it is true, but still
plainly not a uniform.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Glad to see you boys again,” said Stubbs, as Hal
and Chester walked up to him. “Where’ve you been
all these days?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fighting,” said Chester, “which is more than
you can say, Mr. Stubbs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That so?” said Stubbs in a huff. “Maybe you
think I was out in No Man’s Land there for my
health, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, hardly,” Hal broke in, “but I’ll wager you
didn’t go out there to have a shot at a Boche.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Mr. Stubbs,” said Chester, “tell us just
why you were in that shell hole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was in that hole,” said Stubbs, “because the
managing editor of the New York <i>Gazette</i> said he
wanted a good descriptive story of a battle. I figured
that a shell hole was as good a place as any to
see what was going on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still a newspaper man, then, Stubbs?” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you had gone out of that business,”
said Chester. “I remember finding you in Berlin
once on a mission that had nothing to do with a
newspaper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, well, a fellow likes to help out once in a
while,” rejoined Stubbs modestly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then why don’t you shoulder a gun, Stubbs?”
demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here,” said Stubbs angrily. “I’m getting
good and tired of having you fellows pick on me all
the time. I haven’t joined out because, in the first
place, I’m no fighter. I’m of a great deal more
value in this war in my present capacity. There are
enough young men to do the fighting. I’m trying
to keep the folks back home in touch with what
you’re doing. And you can believe me or not, they
are glad to be kept in touch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve no doubt of it, Mr. Stubbs,” said Hal with
a smile. “Never mind, we won’t pester you any
more for a while.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For a while, eh?” said Stubbs, grinning. “I
didn’t think you could mean permanently.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment Captain O’Neil approached. Hal
and Chester saluted and stood at attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You had better turn in, lieutenants,” said the
captain. He eyed Stubbs closely. “What’s this
man doing here?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“War correspondent, sir,” replied Hal, and introduced
Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have no business at the front, Mr. Stubbs,”
said Captain O’Neil. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask
you to leave. Not that I am afraid you’ll let loose
any military secrets—the censor will see to that
when you file your dispatches—but it’s against orders,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe so,” said Stubbs, “but somebody has to
tell the people at home what is going on over here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The proper authorities will see to that, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Stubbs, “in my mind the newspapers
are the proper authorities in this case. They
know how to tell the people so they will understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t wish to quarrel with you, sir,” said Captain
O’Neil sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor I,” said Stubbs. “I’m not a fighting man,
captain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, sir, you must leave at once or I shall be
forced to place you under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no you won’t,” said Stubbs grimly. “Hold
on,” he cried, as Captain O’Neil took a step forward.
“No offense, captain. Just have a look at
this paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He produced a document from his pocket and
passed it to the captain. Captain O’Neil read it
quickly and then passed it back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why didn’t you say in the first place that you
had a pass from the commander-in-chief?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You didn’t give me time, captain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain O’Neil turned to Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may care for the company of war correspondents,”
he said with some heat. “Every man
to his choice. But I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned on his heel and strode away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There, Stubbs,” said Chester. “You’ve made
him mad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I can’t help it because he is so touchy,
can I?” asked Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps not. But there was no need to offend
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Most of these officers are a trifle too cocky,” declared
Stubbs. “I thought I’d take him down a peg.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t forget, Mr. Stubbs,” said Chester, taking
a step forward, “that I’m an officer, too. I can
have you placed under arrest, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You won’t, though,” said Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Won’t I?” said Chester. “Why won’t I?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the first place,” said Stubbs, “because you are
too glad to see me again. And in the second place,
because I’ve got something to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out with it then, Mr. Stubbs,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait a minute, now, just wait a minute,” said
Stubbs. “Take me to your quarters where we can
be quiet. You’ll have to put me up for the night,
anyhow, and we might as well be comfortable while
we chat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three made their way to the lads’ quarters.
Stubbs sat down on the edge of Hal’s bunk and produced
a pipe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Learned to smoke yet?” he asked of the boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not yet, Stubbs,” said Hal, “and I guess we
never will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take my advice and learn,” said Stubbs. “It’s
a great comfort to a man sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps,” said Chester. “But it’s a habit too
easily cultivated and too hard to stop. I’m satisfied
without tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Every man to his taste, as Captain O’Neil says,”
commented Stubbs with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Stubbs,” said Hal. “You said you had
something to tell us. Out with it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Stubbs puffed away for some moments in silence
and it was plain to Hal and Chester that he was
thinking deeply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose I really should say nothing,” said
Stubbs, “but I know that I can depend on you boys
to repeat nothing I say. Besides, I’ve simply got
to express my feelings to someone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If it’s only an expression of feeling, maybe it
isn’t so important after all, Stubbs,” remarked Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Stubbs, “the thing that I mean is
this. I am willing to bet anything I ever expect to
have that what I have learned in the last few days is
going to result in an Allied offensive that will put
an end to this war.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester sprang to their feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re sure, Stubbs?” demanded Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sure enough in my own mind,” declared the
war correspondent, waving the lads back to their
seats. “Of course, it is always possible that things
won’t work out the way I figure; but knowing the
caliber of a certain man in Uncle Sam’s expeditionary
forces I figure that they will work out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Explain, Mr. Stubbs,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Has it ever struck either of you,” said Stubbs
slowly, between puffs at his pipe, “that it’s all foolishness
for the Allies to remain snug and wait until
the enemy does the attacking? I mean, haven’t you
thought that perhaps more could be accomplished if
the Allies carried the fighting to the foe?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal nodded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, the same thought has struck some one
else,” declared Stubbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean——” began Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly,” said Stubbs. “I mean General Pershing,
unless I have been grossly misinformed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean that General Pershing will order an
American advance?” exclaimed Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no. He can’t do that. Marshal Foch is
commander-in-chief of the Allied forces and it’s up
to him to decide. What I mean is that General
Pershing is not altogether pleased with the progress
of events. I am informed that he believes a grand
offensive on all fronts would do more toward ending
the war right now than any other one thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, why doesn’t he tell Marshal Foch so?”
demanded Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” said Stubbs quietly, “is what I am informed
he intends to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurray!” shouted Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quiet,” said Stubbs sharply. “Not a word of
what I have told you must be repeated. It doesn’t
make any difference how I know all this. It’s sufficient
that I do know it. However, things may not
work out as I expect. It is possible that General
Pershing’s advice may not prevail. He may be
overruled by Marshal Foch and General Haig at
their conference Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So there is going to be a conference, eh?” said
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. As I say, the conference is to be held
Thursday, day after to-morrow. It will be held in
Marshal Foch’s headquarters. It may result in developments
and it may not. At all events, I am
quite certain that General Pershing will go to the
conference prepared to urge an immediate advance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove! That sounds awfully good to me!”
declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And to me,” agreed Hal. “I’d like to be present
at that conference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’d all like to be there,” said Stubbs dryly.
“But there’s not a chance. Not a chance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But, as it developed, there was a chance; not a
chance for Stubbs, war correspondent, perhaps, but
more than a chance for Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was pure accident that gave them this opportunity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />A PIECE OF LUCK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Eight o’clock Thursday morning found Hal and
Chester, in a large army automobile, returning from
the quarters of General Lawrence, where they had
been sent by General Allen, who commanded the division
in which the boys served.</p>

<p class='c005'>As they rode along, Hal, turning a sharp curve,
applied the emergency brakes and brought the car
to a stop only a few feet from a second machine,
which appeared to be stalled in the middle of the
road.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were only two figures in the second automobile,
and as Hal looked quickly at the man in the
tonneau he jumped to the ground and came to attention.
Chester, with a quick look at one of the
occupants of the car, did likewise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both lads had recognized General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing returned the salutes and spoke
sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You drive somewhat recklessly, sirs,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Had you not been prompt in applying your brakes
you would have run us down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m very sorry, sir,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It can’t be helped now,” said General Pershing,
“and it is good fortune that brings you here now.
My own car has run out of ‘gas,’ due to the carelessness
of my driver. I have sent him for another
car, but now that you are here I shall change.
Come, Colonel Gibson.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The American general and his companion alighted
and took seats in Hal’s car. General Pershing motioned
Hal to the wheel and Chester was also waved
into a front seat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will drive me to General Lawrence’s quarters,”
said General Pershing, “and this will give
you an opportunity to do all the speeding you care
to. I must see General Lawrence and be back at
my own headquarters by noon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned the car quickly and soon was speeding
in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither Hal nor Chester said a word as the car
sped on. The trip to General Lawrence’s quarters
was made in record time, and Hal and Chester remained
in the car while the two generals talked
alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later General Pershing, still accompanied
by Colonel Gibson, re-entered the automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know where my temporary quarters are in
the city of Soissons?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir,” replied Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing leaned forward in the car and
gazed at the two lads closely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surely I know you two officers,” he said. “Your
faces are very familiar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir,” said Hal. “We had the pleasure of
going to Berlin for you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing clapped his hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you now,” he said. “Colonel, these are
the young officers who went to Berlin and brought
back the list of German spies in America.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That so, sir?” said Colonel Gibson. “Seems to
me they are very young to have been entrusted with
such a task.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young they are in years,” said the American
commander-in-chief, “but they are older than a good
many of us in experience, so far as this war is concerned.
If my memory serves me right, I believe
they put in several years with the French and British
before the United States entered the conflict.
Am I right?” he asked of Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, sir,” said General Pershing, “you will
make all haste toward my headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal sent the car forward with a lurch and in a
moment they were speeding toward Soissons at a
rate of speed close to sixty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>From time to time, they passed a car going in
the opposite direction, and several times going
around curves they seemed in imminent danger of
running into another machine. But Hal was a
careful, though swift, driver, and his hands were
perfectly steady on the wheel.</p>

<p class='c005'>They flashed through several little villages so fast
that the natives stared in open-mouthed wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s sense of direction stood him in good stead,
and he did not find it necessary to stop once and ask
directions. He had been over the road many times
before and he swerved from road to road with unerring
certainty.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the rear seat, General Pershing and Colonel
Gibson talked guardedly and neither Hal nor Chester
could understand what they said had they wished
to eavesdrop. But such was not their intention.
Both lads were highly elated at their good fortune,
for both realized perfectly that it was no small honor
to drive and ride in the car occupied by the commander-in-chief
of all the American forces in
France.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours passed and Hal began to recognize
the familiar landmarks of the city of Soissons. He
breathed a sigh of relief, for while he was confident
in his own mind that he had kept to the right road,
there was always the possibility that he might mistake
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>He slowed the car down a trifle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We should reach your headquarters in fifteen
minutes, sir,” he called to General Pershing over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>The American commander made no reply, but
Hal had expected none.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was less than fifteen minutes later that Hal
drew the automobile to a stop before the handsome
villa that General Pershing occupied as his headquarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A fine piece of driving, lieutenant,” said General
Pershing to Hal, as he alighted, followed by
Colonel Gibson.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you both report to me in my private office
in fifteen minutes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir,” said Hal and Chester almost in one
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>They, too, had alighted from the car and now
stood at attention as General Pershing and Colonel
Gibson ascended the few steps to the door of the
old French villa.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wonder what he wants with us now?” said Hal,
after the American commander had disappeared
within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe he wants us to drive him to Marshal
Foch’s headquarters in time for the conference
Stubbs mentioned,” replied Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove! Maybe that is it,” exclaimed Hal.
“But I’d like to go farther than that. I’d like to be
present at the conference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess that’s asking a little too much,” smiled
Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps, but I’d give a whole lot to be there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads continued to speculate until Hal, after
a glance at his watch, announced that it was time to
report to General Pershing. They ascended the
steps and gave their names to the orderly at the
door. They were ushered immediately into their
commander’s private office, thus indicating that the
latter had given word to expect them.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing was seated at his desk in the
far corner of the room when Hal and Chester entered.
His back was to the door and he did not see
them. The lads came to attention and waited.</p>

<p class='c005'>After scrawling his name to several documents,
General Pershing swung about in his chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As you know,” he said, addressing both lads
without preliminaries, “my regular driver has been
left far behind. It is imperative that I reach the
headquarters of Marshal Foch by four o’clock this
afternoon and for that reason I have decided to impress
you into service as my driver, Lieutenant
Paine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” said Hal, saluting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you, Lieutenant Crawford,” continued the
American commander, “will accompany your friend
because I know how inseparable you are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you overhaul the car, lieutenant, and see
that it is perfectly fit?” instructed General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal saluted again, and would have turned on his
heel to depart, but his commander stayed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One moment,” he said. “I have done some
thinking in the last few minutes and I am convinced
that you young men are the ones I may have need
of for a certain piece of important work. I can’t
say as much as I would like to right now. But I
can say this: I shall confer with Marshal Foch and
Marshal Haig this afternoon on a certain matter.
If the conference results as I hope it will, I shall
not have need of you; or if I fail to make my point
I shall have no need of you. If the conference,
however, fails to reach a definite decision I shall
have need of at least two courageous and daring
spirits. In view of your past successes, I believe
that I may depend on you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing paused.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We will do the best we can, sir,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because you must be familiar with my views to
render the best possible service,” General Pershing
went on, “I am inclined to believe that it would be
well to have you present at the conference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s heart leaped into his throat with joy. Chester
had hard work repressing a wild hurrah. But
neither said a word nor moved a facial muscle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will learn at the conference,” said General
Pershing, “what I am not at liberty to say now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We know what we shall learn, all right,” said
Hal to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” continued the American commander, “if
you will look over the car carefully, I will be with
you inside of ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester saluted their commander,
wheeled on their heels and marched from the
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurrah, Hal!” shouted Chester when they were
out of earshot of their commander’s office. “What
do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid it’s too good to be true,” declared
Hal. “I’m afraid I shall wake up and find it only
a dream. Better pinch me so I know I’m not
asleep. Ouch!” he cried, as Chester applied thumb
and forefinger to his arm. “I didn’t mean for you
to take me literally. Guess I’m awake all right.
Now for the car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal went over the car carefully. It was in perfect
shape. The gasoline tank was replenished and
Hal gave the car a “drink.” Hardly had he completed
his task, when Chester cried:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quick, Hal! Here he comes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later General Pershing, accompanied
by two of his staff, climbed into the car. Hal took
his place at the wheel. Chester sat beside him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A little speed, lieutenant!” said General Pershing,
with a half smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal sent the big automobile forward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />THE CONFERENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was now after noon and Hal knew that it
would require swift driving to reach Marshal Foch’s
headquarters, near Paris, before four o’clock, the
hour of the conference. Nevertheless, the lad had
perfect confidence in himself and his ability to handle
the big army automobile, and he felt quite certain
that he would reach the French commander’s
headquarters before the appointed hour, barring accidents.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both Hal and Chester were almost bubbling over
with excitement, for each felt sure that he was to be
present at a time when history was to be made.
Naturally, in spite of the fact that they had seen
active service with the British and French, both
had the utmost confidence in General Pershing and
each was positive in his own mind that the counsel
of the American commander would prevail.</p>

<p class='c005'>The trip passed without incident. Hal kept the
huge car going at top speed most of the time, slowing
down only for the sharpest curves and to avoid
possible collisions with cars approaching from the
opposite direction. Therefore, it was not yet half
past three o’clock when the automobile drew into
the outskirts of the little town where Field Marshal
Foch, commander of all the Allied forces, had established
his headquarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>It became apparent as they moved into the village
that news of the approaching conference had
spread through the troops. The British, French
and what few American soldiers there were in that
particular sector cheered wildly as the automobile
bearing the American commander-in-chief flashed
by.</p>

<p class='c005'>Directly Hal brought the machine to a halt in
front of a house somewhat larger than the rest,
over which floated the combined flags of the three
nations—France, England and the United States.
Hal guessed rightly that it was in this house that
Marshal Foch made his headquarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the building was a long line of French soldiers.
To the right, these were flanked by a platoon
of British, while on the left stood the American
guard of honor. Nearby was a large automobile
bearing the British arms. Chester surmised correctly
that Marshal Haig had already arrived.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing stepped lightly from his car.
Before moving away, surrounded by his staff, he
motioned Hal and Chester to follow him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads followed their commander up the short
flight of steps and presently he and his staff were
ushered into a large room in the rear on the first
floor. At the door General Pershing was greeted
by Marshal Foch and Marshal Haig in person, for
the French and British commanders were not standing
upon ceremony.</p>

<p class='c005'>Inside, the three commanders took seats at a
table in the center of the room, the members of their
various staffs standing behind them. Besides the
formal salutes when the three commanders met,
there had been a hearty handshake all around. Now
they were ready for business.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Foch arose and spoke to General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have called this conference at your request,
General,” he said, “so it would seem to me that we
should hear from you first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Foch sat down and General Pershing
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First, sir,” he said, “I must explain the presence
here of so many of my aides. Besides several members
of my regular staff, I am accompanied by two
young lieutenants whom, if I am not mistaken, Sir
Douglas Haig knows well. I refer to Lieutenants
Paine and Crawford.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Haig nodded to General Pershing and
then to Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know them well,” he said, and then to Hal and
Chester: “Glad to see you again, sirs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester saluted stiffly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have brought them here,” said General Pershing,
“in order that they may hear what I have to
say, for it may be that I shall have need of them
to prove to you the correctness of my views.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You need make no apology for their presence,
General,” said Marshal Foch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” returned General Pershing. “I
shall proceed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Every ear in the room was strained to catch the
next few words of the American commander, for
there was not a man in the room who did not realize
that it must have been a matter of prime importance
thus to bring the three great commanders together.
It is probable that most of the American officers
present had a general idea of what General Pershing
was about to propose; but neither the British
nor French commanders or members of their staffs
had had an inkling of it. Hal and Chester listened
eagerly for General Pershing’s next words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to ask you, gentlemen,” said General
Pershing quietly, toying with a paperweight on the
table as he spoke, “whether you do not think we
have remained passive long enough—whether it is
not, in your opinion, time that we assumed the offensive
rather than to wait until the enemy brings
the fight to us?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Foch and Marshal Haig were on their
feet in a moment. Marshal Haig spoke first.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean that you would have us attack at
once?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do, sir,” returned General Pershing grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was an audible catching of breaths
throughout the room. Marshal Foch was silent a
full moment. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“We haven’t the men, general.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Black Jack” Pershing scowled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter with the Americans?” he demanded.
“I’ve a million of them over here and
there are more coming. They’ve been here for
months and have done practically nothing and they
want to know why. What’s the matter with the
Americans, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Foch shrugged his shoulders and elevated
his hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, sir,” he protested, “they are untrained, unseasoned,
raw troops. Surely you cannot expect
them to stand against the enemy’s veterans. It
would be suicide.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I agree with Marshal Foch,” Marshal Haig interposed.
“It is true they have proven their mettle
wherever they have gone into action, but they have
not had the training.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An angry light gleamed in General Pershing’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll go any place you order ’em, sir. I’ll
stake my reputation on that,” he thundered.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hush of expectancy fell over the room. The
air was surcharged with excitement.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of the feeling of pride at his commander’s
words, Hal felt a thrill of fear shoot through
him. Was it possible that the heads of the Allied
armies were about to quarrel?</p>

<p class='c005'>But Hal need not have worried. Men like these
did not indulge in foolish quarrels. They spoke
strongly because they felt strongly, and each realized
that the other was advancing views that he considered
best.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing brought a clenched fist down on
the table. Pens and ink stands jumped and rattled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say that we have delayed long enough,” he
declared. “What have we been doing to regain lost
territory? Nothing. True, we’ve halted the enemy
every time he struck, but we’ve not regained a mile
of lost ground. I say it’s time to hit back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If we only had the necessary numerical superiority,”
said Marshal Haig.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you, sir,” said General Pershing, “that my
men can stand up—yes, they can go through—the
best the enemy has to offer. Their morale is the
greatest of any army that ever existed. Order them
to drive the enemy back, and they’ll drive him back.
I know what I am talking about, sirs. Try them!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again there was silence in the room, broken at
last by Marshal Foch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is well,” he said, “for a general to have that
confidence in his men; and I am sure that your men
have every bit as much confidence in you. I am
impressed with your words; and yet I am loath to act
on your suggestion with untried troops. I have
seen such troops in action—the Portuguese. The
enemy scattered them like chaff before the wind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My men are Americans, sir,” said General Pershing
simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I know the traditions of the American fighting
man,” said Marshal Foch. “I know that the
trained American soldier is the equal of any in the
world. But still I hesitate. If I could only be sure
that the enemy has exhausted himself in his latest
offensive—if I only knew the disposition of his
forces—then I might act. I have, of course, a general
idea of the enemy’s activities, but not enough,
I am afraid, in ordering a grand offensive, as you
suggest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care anything about the enemy’s positions,”
declared General Pershing. “What I say is
this: Order the Americans to break the German line
and they’ll break it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Marshal Foch shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid the time is not ripe,” he said sadly.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment General Pershing seemed on the
verge of making an angry retort. Instead, he said
quietly:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was prepared to hear you advance such views,
sir, so I have another suggestion to offer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Proceed, sir,” said Marshal Foch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is this,” said General Pershing: “I want to
ask you if you will act on my suggestion if I can
gain for you such information as will convince you
that the time is really ripe to strike? Will you act
on my suggestion if I furnish you with better figures
as to the enemy’s strength in the various battle
sectors and the disposition of his troops?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why,” replied Marshal Foch, “if you can show
me that the time is ripe to strike, of course I shall
strike. But I fear that is a very large task, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very true, sir. Yet I shall endeavor to fulfill it.
It was for that reason, sir, that I brought with me
the two young lieutenants I mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marshal Foch surveyed Hal and Chester keenly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are very young,” he said deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“True,” said General Pershing, “yet I say with all
positiveness that they are among the most capable
of my officers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can vouch for that, sir,” said Marshal Haig.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Marshal Foch surveyed the lads closely,
much to their embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Their names?” he asked of General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lieutenants Paine and Crawford, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lieutenants Paine and Crawford,” said Marshal
Foch, in a very quiet voice, “will you please step forward?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />INTO THE ENEMY’S COUNTRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Hal and Chester advanced to the center of the
room. They realized that all eyes were on them
and they held themselves stiffly erect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is high praise I have heard of you, sirs,” said
Marshal Foch quietly. “I trust that, should we have
further need of your services, you will be as fortunate
as I judge you have been in the past.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester bowed slightly, but said nothing.
Marshal Foch turned to General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know as there is need of further discussion,”
he said. “If you have decided, general,
that you will entrust the work you have mentioned
to these young officers, I should say that the sooner
they get about it the better for all concerned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In that event,” continued Marshal Foch, “I declare
this conference adjourned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a scuffling of feet as the commanders
and their staffs moved toward the door. Almost
before they had all departed, Marshal Foch had
turned again to his desk and was immersed in a
mass of documents and maps.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing led the way directly toward his
automobile, and motioned Hal again to the driver’s
seat. Chester climbed in beside his chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Back to my headquarters,” General Pershing
instructed Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The return trip was made in silence and in record
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>As General Pershing alighted before his own
quarters, he motioned Hal and Chester to accompany
him to his office. Once there, he dismissed
all members of his staff, and spoke to the two lads.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know, of course,” he said, “what I wish you
to ascertain for me, and you know also why I desire
this information. If you are not prepared to
undertake this mission, I wish you to understand
that you may say so without fear of censure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We shall be very glad to do what we can, sir,”
said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” said General Pershing. “Now I
want you both to realize the necessity of haste, but
at the same time I want you to act with caution
enough not to jeopardize the result of your mission.
The main thing is that I must have the facts. That
is why I believe it is better that two men be dispatched
about the work. If one man comes to grief,
the other may return safely. You understand
that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perfectly, sir,” replied Hal quietly. “You may
be sure that neither of us will risk a failure merely
to help the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well spoken,” said General Pershing. “I feel
sure that I could not entrust the task to better
hands.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” was the reply from both lads.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said General Pershing, “I do not wish
to burden you with orders and instructions. It is
my belief that you have more chance of success if
given a free hand. Therefore, I shall leave it to
you entirely to choose your method of campaign.
But remember the essential points—the strength and
disposition of the enemy’s troops in the various battle
sectors, and the question of whether the morale
of the German armies is still equal to withstanding
an offensive such as I suggested at the conference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We understand, sir,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is all then,” said the American commander.
“You will report to me the result of your mission at
the earliest possible moment. I must impress upon
you, however, the fact that results may be more far-reaching
if you can make it convenient to return
within seven days.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We shall do our best to return within that time,
sir,” declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then good luck to you,” said General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both lads saluted again stiffly, turned sharply upon
their heels and left their commander’s quarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Chester,” said Hal, when they were outside
again, “it seems that we have quite a sizeable
task ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” agreed Chester, “and I can’t say that I
have any more idea of how to go about it than I
have of capturing the Kaiser himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor I. At the same time, however, we can both
see that if we are to learn anything of the enemy’s
plans and conditions it is up to us to get in contact
with the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly. But the question is, how?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s simply got to be done,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sounds very simple, to hear you talk,” he said.
“Perhaps you can suggest a plan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “we’ve been within the German
lines before. I guess we can get there again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, it’s easy enough to get in. The trouble is
going to be getting out,” Chester grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to take our chances there,” declared
Hal. “The first thing to do is get there. We’ll
worry about the return part of it later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good,” said Chester, “but how are we going
to get there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are several ways,” said Hal. “We can
go by airship, automobile, horseback, or we can
walk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And we’ll be taken prisoners in either case, most
likely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s true enough. But we can’t do anything
from here. However, we’ve been prisoners before
now and have come through all right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But there may be a time when we won’t come
through,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t croak,” said Hal. “You’re beginning to
talk like Stubbs, Chester.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not croaking,” declared Chester. “But I
believe in looking on both sides of a question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All well and good; but you’ll agree with me that
the first thing to be done is to get within striking
distance of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly, and I’m leaving it up to you to find the
way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “I suggest that we take this
automobile and keep going until we reach the German
lines. We can concoct some cock and bull
story that will account for our presence there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe you can,” said Chester. “I don’t believe
my imagination will carry that far.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Climb in anyhow, and we’ll be moving,” said
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester did as Hal suggested and a few moments
later the large army automobile was again heading
toward the front.</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon Hal’s advice, they did not return to their
own regiment, but made straight for the front lines
now held by General Lawrence and his combined
infantry and marines.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We might as well go through there as elsewhere,”
Hal said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anything that suits you suits me,” was Chester’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before General Lawrence’s headquarters, Hal
brought the machine to a stop and sought counsel
with the general. In a few words the lad explained
the nature of their mission, and added:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you would have word sent to Captain
O’Neil. He probably will be alarmed at our absence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It shall be done at once,” was General Lawrence’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester re-entered the automobile and
continued their journey toward the enemy’s country.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the way, Hal,” said Chester, “don’t you
think it would be wise to discard these American
uniforms?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hardly,” said Hal. “We don’t want to be shot
as spies, you know. In regulation uniform, the
worst they can do if they capture us is to make us
prisoners of war. But with a spy it’s different.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s true enough,” Chester agreed, “and still
we have often found it convenient to enter the enemy’s
lines in civilian attire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am against it in this case,” Hal argued,
“because we are working against time, in the first place.
If we are taken prisoner, well and good. In fact,
I am sure that we shall be captured.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then it seems to me that our mission is doomed
to failure,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all. I believe that we shall have more
chance of making our escape if we are apprehended
as American officers than if we are taken as possible
spies. The life of a spy, or even a suspect, you
know, is short.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks to me,” said Chester dryly, “as though
the lives of Lieutenants Paine and Crawford were
going to be short, no matter how you figure it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There you go croaking again,” said Hal.
“Never yell until you’re hurt. That’s a good axiom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s too late then,” declared Chester with a grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal, “there is no use talking about
it. Either we are going ahead or we are going to
stay here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s be going then,” said Chester. “I’m going
to vote for you to lead this expedition, and whatever
you say goes. That stands until we return to
the American lines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good,” said Hal. “So as long as I am
the boss of the outfit, I’ll give my orders. Get back
into the automobile and we’ll be moving.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester took his seat and Hal jumped to the
wheel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The automobile moved toward the front again.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads were hailed several times by American
outposts as they went rapidly forward. To the
Americans it must have seemed foolhardy for the
two young officers to be driving directly toward the
enemy’s lines. But Hal did not slow down when
hailed, so there was nothing for the American soldiers
to do but let them pass.</p>

<p class='c005'>And at the last the last American position had
passed and the automobile moved into No Man’s
Land beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short distance away, Hal saw the German
trenches.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, here we go,” he said quietly to Chester.
“Maybe we’ll get back and maybe we won’t. But
at all events, we’ll give the best that is in us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Amen,” said Chester fervently.</p>

<p class='c005'>They drove straight toward the German lines.
Five minutes after Chester’s last remark, Hal slowed
the car down in response to a sudden command.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Halt!” came a sharp voice in German.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />PRISONERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Immediately Hal had brought the car to a stop,
he raised his hands high above his head. Chester
followed his example. A moment later the machine
was surrounded by a score of German soldiers,
a lieutenant at their head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you doing here?” demanded the German
officer sharply of Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove, Hal!” cried Chester in well simulated
surprise. “They’re Germans. You’ve run right
into a nest of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it would seem,” replied Hal, immediately
falling in with Chester’s ruse. “Now that’s what I
call bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This conversation was carried on in English, but
Chester had hopes that the German officer or one
of his men would understand it. Much to the lad’s
delight, the next remark came from the German
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you’ve run into our lines accidentally?” he
said. “Well, so much the worse for you. You’re
Americans, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are,” replied Hal, in German.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve always said,” declared the lieutenant, “that
you Americans would make fools of yourselves over
here. You’re a couple of fair examples; you can’t
even keep your sense of direction. Get out of that
car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester did as they were commanded,
and as they alighted they were immediately surrounded
by the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you armed?” asked the German.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal tossed a single automatic toward the lieutenant.
Chester followed suit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There you are,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment the lad was afraid the enemy would
search him and Chester for further weapons, but
the man apparently never even thought of such action.
Slyly Hal slipped his hand inside his coat
and made sure that his second revolver was secure.
Chester also had concealed a second revolver within
his coat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forward, march!” commanded the German officer,
and Hal and Chester, hemmed in by enemy
soldiers, set off at a swift pace.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both lads kept their eyes open as they were led
along. Apparently the position in which they found
themselves was not well fortified, for it showed the
result of hasty intrenching.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no firing in this particular sector of
the battlefield for the moment, but to the north and
south Hal and Chester could hear the rumble of the
big guns as the artillery duel continued on each
flank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are you going to take us, lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“None of your business,” was their captor’s response.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re not a very civil sort of a fellow, are
you?” demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold your tongue, if you know what’s good for
you,” was the response. “We don’t have time to
bother with a pair of American pigs. You’ll be
lucky if you are not ordered shot at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I guess they won’t shoot us,” said Hal
quietly. “We’re prisoners of war, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you wouldn’t be the first to be shot offhand,”
said the German lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve heard that you’re a rather barbarous lot,”
returned Hal, “but I didn’t know you were as bad as
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The German stepped close to Hal and shook his
fist in the lad’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s enough out of you,” he cried angrily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make me laugh,” said Hal, smiling.</p>

<p class='c005'>For answer the man drew back his right hand
and struck Hal a swift blow in the face. Hal,
throwing off the men who surrounded him, promptly
knocked the lieutenant down.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man arose with blood streaming from his lips
and an angry light in his eye. With his right hand
he drew his revolver, while he cried to his men:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shoot him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>To the German soldier, an officer’s word was law.
It was not for the soldier to consider the merits of
the case. An order had been given, and German discipline
said that it must be obeyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>A dozen rifles covered Hal instantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>But an interruption came from an unexpected
source.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop!” cried a commanding voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly the rifles were lowered and the soldiers
came to attention, while the German lieutenant lowered
his revolver and saluted stiffly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not ten paces away sat a German officer on horseback.
He wore the shoulder straps of a general of
infantry, as both lads saw at a glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the meaning of this?” demanded the
general.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One of these men knocked me down, sir,” the
German lieutenant replied, “and I was about to have
him shot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So,” said the general, “and why did he knock
you down, if I may ask, lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The German stuttered and hung his head. It was
Hal who replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He struck me first, your excellency.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I thought,” said the German general. “I’ve
heard of your actions before, Lieutenant Leffler.
Do not let me hear of your offending again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But sir——” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Enough!” was the general’s stern command.
“See that your prisoners are made secure and then
report immediately to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lieutenant saluted stiffly, but Chester noted
an angry gleam in his eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph!” said the lad. “He apparently has no
love for his general. Looks like he would like to
put a bullet through him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The German commander, without further thought
of his subordinate, had wheeled his horse and was
about to ride away. At that moment the German
lieutenant, with an audible snarl, suddenly whipped
out his revolver and covered his general.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Chester was too quick for the man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking a quick step forward, he sent the would-be
assassin’s revolver spinning into the air by a sudden
blow of his fist. The German lieutenant, thus
foiled in his purpose, turned and grappled with the
lad.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal sprang to his chum’s assistance, while the
German soldiers closed in about him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German general, attracted by the sounds of
the commotion but not knowing what the trouble
was about, wheeled his horse again and rushed into
the thick of the melee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here! Here!” he cried. “Stop that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately the soldiers drew off. The German
lieutenant, however, was too furious even to heed
the order of his commanding officer. His fingers
sought Chester’s throat.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Chester, athlete that he was, was too quick
for his opponent, and he held the man off despite the
fact that in strength he was hardly a match for
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German lieutenant suddenly released his hold
and stepped back. His hand dropped to his belt,
where hung a long sheath knife. The knife flashed
aloft and Chester staggered back quickly to avoid
the descending blow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the man could strike again, Hal sprang
forward and seized the man’s arm from behind. He
twisted sharply and the knife fell to the ground.
The German whirled quickly, but Hal dropped him
with a well-directed right-hand blow to the point
of the chin. The German lieutenant lay still.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German general by this time had dismounted
and had been hurrying forward even as Hal put his
adversary down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well done!” shouted the German commander in
excellent English. “Well done, I say! But what is
all this commotion about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you please, sir,” said one of the soldiers, stepping
forward, “Lieutenant Leffler was trying to
shoot you when this American officer”—and he indicated
Chester—“interfered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So?” exclaimed the general in utter astonishment.
“It has come to this, eh? How dare a
German soldier lift a hand toward his superior officer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He drew near and stirred the prostrate body of
Lieutenant Leffler with his foot. Then he turned
to Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I have to thank an enemy for saving my life,
eh?” he said in a quiet voice. “I am sorry that we
are enemies, sir, for I have been in your America.
Well, I thank you. If there is anything I can do
for you at any time, call upon me. But what are
you doing within our lines?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a few words Chester repeated the story told
the German lieutenant a few moments before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lost, eh?” said the general. “Well, it’s too bad,
of course. I can’t send you back to your own lines,
for you have been captured within ours. That
means that you are prisoners of war until the war
ends, or until you are exchanged—which is unlikely,”
he added as an afterthought.</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned to one of the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s your name, my man?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Loeder, sir!” replied the man addressed, saluting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, Loeder. I appoint you to make sure
that the prisoners are turned over to Colonel Ludwig.
You will also take Lieutenant Leffler there
and confine him to his quarters, under arrest. A
courtmartial shall sit on his case in the morning.
You are in command of this squad, Loeder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, sir,” replied Loeder.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Lieutenant Leffler was lifted to his feet at
the command of Loeder, the German general again
mounted his horse. As he was about to put spur to
the animal, he seemed struck with a sudden thought,
and with a command to Loeder, halted the march of
the party surrounding Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A moment!” he called. “What are your names,
sirs?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester replied for both.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall remember them,” replied the German
general quietly, “and if you are ever in need while
within our lines, I ask that you call upon me, I am
General von Mackensen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He wheeled his horse and rode rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott, Hal!” said Chester. “What do you
think of that? I guess we’re safe enough while
we’re here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So we are,” agreed Hal dryly, “as long as they
don’t know just why we are here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads about-faced with their captors and were
led away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />BOUND FOR A GERMAN PRISON CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“We’re getting too far into Germany altogether,
Hal,” said Chester, as the train that was carrying
them toward the enemy prison camp at Villingen,
one of the many improvised shelters for captives
that dotted the German frontier, sped along.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it,” said Hal. “It looks as though we
were going to have a pretty stiff time getting back
in time to do any good, if we get back at all before
the war is over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester gazed from the window of the car at the
fleeting landscape.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know where we are,” he said at length,
“but we must have passed the German border.
Also, we are bound north, so Villingen must be in
the direction of Hamburg.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I don’t know where we are either,” declared
Hal, “but if I had a good chance I’d jump
off this train and take to my heels.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What good would that do? If you didn’t kill
yourself, chances are they’d stop the train and the
guards would pick you up again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe so,” said Hal, “but it’s worth a chance,
to my way of thinking. If we could get a long
enough start we might be all right. Certainly, once
free, we should be able to appropriate clothing
enough to cover these uniforms, and once disguised,
I defy any of these Boches to find us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester, casting a shrewd eye the
length of the common day coach, “we’re not so well
guarded we can’t try it if you say the word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal also glanced up and down the aisle. Forward,
the German guards had gathered together
over a game of cards. There were no guards at the
rear of the car, but both boys knew that the door
was locked and the vestibule without, closed. It
would take time to break through the door, open the
vestibule and leap from the train.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If we can get close enough to the door without
arousing suspicion, there’s a bare chance,” whispered
Hal. “If the train slows down a trifle and
we pass through a woods or forest soon I am in
favor of taking a chance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suits me if it does you,” declared Chester with
a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll see first whether we can get close to the
door,” said Hal. “You wait here a minute.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He arose and moved up the aisle. A German
guard espied him from the other end of the car.
“Sit down!” he commanded in a gruff voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal turned and walked forward in the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just stretching my legs a bit,” the boy said with
a smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German grunted, but made no reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several times Hal paced back and forth through
the car, stopping now and then for a word with
some of the other prisoners. Eventually the German
guards seemed to forget him entirely. Then
Hal sat down on the arm of a seat near the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester, who had been watching Hal closely, now
also arose and began pacing up and down, at last
stopping close to Hal near the rear door of the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed that Providence was guiding the actions
of the two young Americans.</p>

<p class='c005'>The speed of the train began to diminish. Inwardly,
Hal and Chester were burning with excitement,
but outwardly neither gave a sign that might
betray them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And then the train entered the fringe of a forest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Time, Chester,” said Hal in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>He got to his feet and moved toward the door,
Chester close behind him.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a sudden crash as Hal broke the glass
pane in the door with his hand. With a single
movement of his arm he swept clear the remaining
fragments and leaped through the opening.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Chester followed him, Hal opened the vestibule
with two swift moves and leaped to the bottom
step. Then, balancing himself carefully, he
dropped from the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal was conscious of his feet striking something
hard. Then he went down. The next he knew,
Chester had seized his arm and was dragging him
to his feet, shouting:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quick, Hal! They’re stopping the train!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal staggered to his feet and the boys dashed
from the embankment and ran for the shelter of
the trees. As they entered this retreat, the train
stopped a short distance away, and German soldiers
jumped to the ground with angry cries.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just within the shelter of the trees, Chester
stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurt, Hal?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess not,” he replied. “I did a bad job when
I hopped off and lost my balance. I’m all right now,
though. How about yourself?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I made it like a railroad man,” was Chester’s
reply. “But come, we must get away from here.
They’re after us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which way?” demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Doesn’t make any particular difference, I guess,”
replied Chester; “but straight ahead suits me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He led the way at a rapid trot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind, the lads could hear the cries of their pursuers,
and they made as rapid progress as possible.
After perhaps two minutes of walking, Chester, who
was slightly in advance of Hal, stopped with a cry
of dismay.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had now come to the edge of the trees and
with the first sight of the wide expanse of open
ground before them, Chester realized that they
were trapped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now what do you think of that!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little woods in which they found themselves
could not have been ten rods in width or in length.
The lads had simply jumped from the train in a little
clump of trees. It would be but the work of a
very few minutes for the German guards to surround
the place and then close in on the fugitives.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, that’s what I call pretty hard luck,” declared
Hal. “And here comes the enemy. Hear
’em?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Footsteps approached from behind.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surrender,” replied Hal quietly. “We can’t afford
to let them kill us, you know, much as we
might like to fight. While there’s life there’s hope
that we may still be successful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” Chester agreed. “Well, here they are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As the first German hove in sight, the man put his
rifle to his shoulder and fired. The bullet passed
between the two lads, who stepped quickly back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait!” called Hal before the man could fire
again. “We surrender.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He raised his hands, as did Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time other Germans had appeared and
they rushed the lads angrily.</p>

<p class='c005'>No more shots were fired, but the first man who
came within striking distance of Hal reversed his
rifle quickly and brought the butt down on the boy’s
unprotected head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal dropped like a log.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly Chester lost all idea of caution. With
an angry cry he sprang at the man who had struck
Hal and before the German could save himself,
Chester stepped in quickly and wrenched the rifle
from his hand. So quick was his action that none
of the enemy had time to interfere, and raising the
rifle aloft Chester served the German as the latter
had his friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly Chester became the center of a struggling
knot of men. Thoroughly aroused by this unexpected
resistance, the Germans attacked the lad
with loud cries. Chester had no time to reverse his
rifle and fire; the press of conflict was too great for
that. Nevertheless, the lad fought as best he could
with clubbed rifle, and then fists, feet and teeth.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans snarled and shouted as they tried
to bring Chester down, but Chester fought in silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the odds were too great against the lad and
at last he went down as a German rifle crashed on
his head. He fell close beside Hal, and his head
rested on his chum’s knees.</p>

<p class='c005'>And that was all that either boy remembered of
the battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Hal returned to consciousness, the train
again was bumping its uneven way through the
country. Hal looked around slowly. At first he
did not realize where he was, but within a few moments
the events of the last few hours came trooping
back to his brain as he gazed around.</p>

<p class='c005'>By his side, nearest the window, was Chester, still
unconscious. Something felt uncomfortable on
Hal’s wrist. He moved his hand. The something
on his wrist pulled. He looked down and for the
first time saw that he and Chester had been handcuffed
together.</p>

<p class='c005'>He smiled to himself grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We put a little respect into them, anyhow,” he
told himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester now engaged his attention. In his present
condition, Hal could do nothing for his friend,
so he sat waiting for him to return to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last Chester’s eyelids began to flutter and his
eyes came open. They sought Hal’s. Hal smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They got us,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester straightened himself up in his seat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I see,” he responded gloomily. “My head
feels as though somebody had dropped a ton of coal
on it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looks it, too,” said Hal. “It’s all nicely bound
up with a dirty rag, I see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess it looks as well as yours, at all events,”
Chester grumbled. “How do you feel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much, and that’s a fact,” said Hal. “My
head feels just like yours looks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know just how it looks by sight of yours,” returned
Chester. “So naturally I know how you
feel. Well, what will they do with us now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Intern us in the prison camp, the same as they
started to do. We’ll have to work and eat next to
nothing and it’ll be pretty tough all around. But
we’ll make another break for liberty at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s hoping it comes soon,” declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>The train slowed down, then stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Villingen; everybody change,” sang out a Yankee
soldier in the rear of the car.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />GERMAN BARBARISM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Under the muzzles of hundreds of German guns,
the prisoners disembarked and were herded together
near what Hal and Chester saw was an improvised
station.</p>

<p class='c005'>Villingen was located in one of the few mining
districts in Germany not far from the Swiss border.
Families of the miners had long since departed,
but the Germans still extracted some coal
from the ground by using prisoners of war beneath
the surface.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was for such work that Hal and the other
American prisoners had been brought to Villingen.
While German prisoners captured by the Allies had
always been well treated, Allied prisoners in German
camps had been forced to undergo cruel and
inhuman treatment from the early days of the war.
A peculiar feature was the fact that seldom did the
German authorities distinguish between officers and
privates. Often British or French officers labored
side by side with private soldiers in the mines and
in the fields.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the prisoners had been herded together,
the German commandant of the camp approached.
He was a porkish-looking individual and typically
Prussian. He answered to the name of Colonel
Bretz. The officer who had been in charge of the
train of prisoners approached and engaged the commandant
in conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>By the frequent looks that the pair cast at Hal
and Chester, the lads knew that they were the chief
subjects of the conversation. Directly the commandant
walked up to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Another attempt to escape and you’ll be shot
like dogs!” he bellowed. He turned to one of his
aides. “Put them in one of the guard cells,” he
continued; “then put these other swine,” with a
sweeping gesture that included the other prisoners,
“in their pens and see that they are ready to go on
the night shift to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He strode away. While the other American soldiers,
covered by German guns, were driven toward
what had once been the living quarters of the
German miners, now hemmed in with steel bars—a
mammoth cage—Hal and Chester were seized by
a squad of soldiers and hurried in the opposite direction,
where they at last were shoved into a filthy,
dirty, single-story building.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was very dark inside and for a moment the
lads were unable to get a view of their surroundings.
But as their eyes became accustomed to the
darkness, they perceived that they were in what
at one time must have served as a store building.
The single room was very small and its furnishings
consisted of two dilapidated chairs and a mass of
dirty rags, apparently meant for a bed, on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nice, sanitary-looking place,” was Hal’s comment,
as he walked about his prison.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess a fellow wouldn’t grow very fat here,”
said Chester. “Wonder how long we’ll be cooped
up?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shrugged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No telling,” he replied, “but when we get out
we’ll probably be sent down in the mines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surely they won’t send us there in our present
condition,” declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t imagine they’ll worry about a couple of
sore heads,” rejoined Hal. “However, time will
tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Chester, “I’m about tired out.
Think I’ll try to sleep a bit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Same here; but I’ll take the bare floor for
mine. I can’t stomach that mass of dirty rags
there. They must be infested with vermin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The floor’s bad enough,” Chester agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>They threw themselves down and in a few moments
were fast asleep in spite of the hard floor, for
both were tired out and could have slept almost any
place.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was still dark when they were aroused from
their slumbers by the presence of a third figure in
the room. Hal opened his eyes as a heavy foot
stirred him and a voice exclaimed in German:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get up. You’ll have to earn your keep here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal arose and Chester also got to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Outside, now, and march quick!” said the German
lieutenant who had awakened them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two lads preceded the man from their prison.
Outside, they inhaled the fresh air eagerly and their
spirits revived.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are you taking us?” demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the mines,” returned the German with a
snarl, “where you’ll loose that fresh look you possess
now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re making a mistake,” said Hal quietly.
“We’re not miners—know nothing about mines.
We’ve never been below.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll be miners or corpses within the next few
days,” bellowed the German. “Go on there!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How about some grub?” questioned Hal.
“We’ve had nothing to eat for more than twenty-four
hours. We won’t be able to work very well
without food, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll eat to-night,” snarled the German. “Not
before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal shrugged again. He was hungry, felt faint,
even, and so did Chester, but there was no help
for it. The lads trudged on in silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon they came to the opening of the mine shaft,
some distance from where they had spent the night.
Other forms began to gather, and Hal guessed
rightly that this was the new shift coming to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Men commenced to appear from below, their
faces, hands and clothing black. These, the lads
knew, were the prisoners who had been working
all night.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a faint streak of light in the east.
The day would break soon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the German guards hustled Hal and Chester
and the other prisoners into the mine shaft,
where they were told off into crews of four and
five men each. Hal and Chester found themselves
together, with a British infantryman and a French
sergeant of cavalry completing their crew. Directly,
picks were thrust into their hands, and they
were provided with gas helmets, upon each of which
burned a small safety light. Then they were
marched to the mouth of the shaft, where they
awaited their turn at the car that was to carry them
below.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You fellows have not been down before, I take
it,” said the English private to Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is the first trip,” replied Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too bad,” was the response. “It’ll be torture
for you. You will probably collapse before time
to come up, in which case you’ll be kicked back to
consciousness. That’s what happened to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If they begin kicking me, they’ll have to go a
bit further,” said Hal grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was what I thought,” said the Englishman.
“I put up a fight, but it wasn’t any use. They
almost beat the life out of me, after which I was
put in solitary confinement with nothing to drink
and almost nothing to eat. Let me tell you, solitary
confinement is worse than the mines, so if you’ll
take my advice, you’ll stick and endure as long as
you can, and when you’ve been kicked back to consciousness
again you’ll return to work and keep
your mouth shut. Am I right, Mercer?” he demanded,
turning to the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oui, monsieur,” returned the latter briefly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Hal shrugged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll see,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the guns of the guards, the four men took
their places in the little elevator-car that was to
carry them below.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get your last look at the outside world,” said
the Englishman, as the starter gave the signal to
descend. “It’ll be the last you get for some time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The little car seemed to drop from beneath the
feet of Hal and Chester as it shot down in the mine.
Hal was conscious of a sinking sensation in the pit
of his stomach. Chester drew his breath sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>The car stopped as suddenly as it had started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here we are,” said the Englishman. “Get out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He led the way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dimly Hal and Chester could make out the interior
of the mine by the light of their torches.
The air was damp and cold. Both lads shivered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This,” explained the Englishman, “is No. 10
level. There are levels above and below us. We’ve
quite a ways to go, so we’ll ride.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal now saw for the first time that a steel track
was before him. On this was a little car, driven
by electricity. It was not a passenger vehicle, but
was used for hauling the ore when mined. The
car was manned by a single German, armed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without a word, the Frenchman took the motorman’s
place. Hal, Chester and the Englishman
climbed aboard and the car moved forward, the
departure being made under the rifle of the German
guard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Isn’t it dangerous down here?” asked Chester
of the Englishman. “I don’t know anything about
mines except that there are many fatalities in them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About the only danger is that of an explosion,”
the Briton replied. “If somebody should strike a
match, we’d all be blown to kingdom come—at least
every man on this level.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are more on this level, then?” asked Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes; probably half a hundred men. Some
are ahead of us and directly more will come along
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seems to me that there might be an opportunity
of making a break for liberty,” declared Hal.
“There are not many guards about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not here,” the Englishman agreed, “but wait
till you get to the pit. There are guards enough
there and they make life as miserable for the prisoners
as possible. You’re expected to work from
the minute you arrive until you knock off or collapse;
and if you go under, you’ll start back to work
the minute you recover.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The little car slowed down and the lads saw light
ahead. It was not daylight, however, but light
made by the glow of many torches. Directly the
car stopped and the four occupants climbed out.
Men stood about with picks and shovels, awaiting
the word to go to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester found themselves placed close
together with the Englishman, who gave the name
of Harding, and the Frenchman, Mercer, as their
nearest neighbors.</p>

<p class='c005'>There came a command from one of the German
guards and the men attacked the solid wall before
them with picks and drills.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Hal grimly, “here’s where we go
to work, Chester.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads wielded their picks with the others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />REVOLT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was not yet six o’clock in the morning when
the first day shift went to work. Under the advice
of the Englishman, Hal and Chester worked as
slowly as possible, the better to accustom their muscles
to their new task. But after an hour’s work,
Hal commenced to grow tired.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, the lad did his best, for common
sense told him that it would be wise not to lag.
Soon after eight o’clock, however, his arms ached
so that it seemed impossible for him to work
longer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He staggered slightly as he drove his pick home.</p>

<p class='c005'>This movement did not escape the keen eye of
the nearest German guard, who immediately approached
and stood watching the lad closely. Again
Hal staggered and his pick fell short of its mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get to work there!” cried the guard sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal tried his best, but it was no use. The pick
fell from his tired hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>The guard stepped quickly forward and struck
the lad sharply across the face with his open left
hand. Under the blow, Hal received new strength
as his fighting spirit was aroused. He stepped toward
the guard, an angry gleam in his eye and his
fists clenched.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German hastily moved back a couple of paces
and half raised his rifle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get to work!” he cried again.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad bethought himself of the Englishman’s
advice, and stooping, recovered his pick. Again he
attacked the wall of coal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester’s strength, meantime, had also given out.
Unlike Hal, however, Chester did not work on until
he could no longer lift his pick. When he felt that
he could no longer dig, he cast his pick away from
him and sat down on the ground. Immediately a
guard was at his side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Up out of there, you American pig!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester glanced at the man idly, but said nothing.
Neither did he get to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the lad was moved from his position by the
square toe of the guard’s heavy boot. Away went
Chester’s thoughts of caution. With a single move,
he seized his pick and sprang forward. The guard
gave ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>The pick flashed above the lad’s head and then
came down sharply. The German escaped the blow
by a quick leap backward. Instantly he lowered his
rifle and there was a flash and a report. Chester
heard the bullet sing past his ear.</p>

<p class='c005'>There came a tramping of hurried feet as other
guards, fearing a concerted revolt, rushed to the
aid of their companion. Gleams of hope lighted the
eyes of the prisoners. Hardly a man there who, at
one time or another, had not thought of escape, and
now, to many, it seemed that the time was ripe.</p>

<p class='c005'>They rushed into the melee.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came the sound of blows and curses in the half-light.
Several rifles spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal, realizing Chester’s danger, in spite of the
aches in his limbs, sprang to his feet and dashed
into the knot of struggling men. British arms
struck out right and left. Frenchmen kicked out
with their heavy boots and bit and clawed. Hal
and Chester, the only Americans below ground in
this section, fought swiftly and silently.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there was only one possible ending for a
struggle such as this. Had the movement been
preconceived and launched in a concerted attack,
the result might have been different, although even
that is doubtful. As it was, outnumbered and with
all the firearms in the hands of the Germans, it was
only a matter of minutes until the prisoners must
be subdued.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the most prominent in the fight was the
Englishman Harding. He was a powerful man, as
Hal had noted at first glance. Day after day of toil
in the mines had added wonderfully to his strength
and he now laid about with his pick with the fury
of a madman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half a dozen guards he had laid low when a
German bullet crashed into his body and brought
him to the ground. His fall seemed to dishearten
the other prisoners, who seem to have looked upon
him as a leader. Their resistance grew feebler and
they gave ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German guards by this time had succeeded
in getting together and now they covered the prisoners
with a score of rifles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fire!” came a command.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the huddled mass of prisoners, five men tumbled
over. Two others groaned and others cursed.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no second volley.</p>

<p class='c005'>Realizing that he had the mutiny under control,
the German officer in command withheld another
fire. The prisoners scattered as the guards advanced.
Hal and Chester were left standing alone
to face the Germans.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both lads by this time had realized the utter foolishness
of further resistance and now quietly
awaited whatever was to come. The German officer
turned to his men.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who started this?” he demanded. “Show me
the leader of this plot!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man whom Chester had attacked, and who
was still on his feet, stepped forward and saluted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those two Americans, sir,” he said, pointing to
Hal and Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So!” exclaimed the German captain.</p>

<p class='c005'>He stepped close to the lads, his revolver ready
in his right hand for instant use.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” he said, “you are the new arrivals, eh?
Well, you shall see how we treat such as you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He reversed his revolver suddenly and brought
the butt down on Chester’s injured head. The lad
dropped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a cry Hal sprang forward and before the
German captain could protect himself Hal’s right
fist sent him staggering back.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cries of joy arose from the prisoners and for a
moment it seemed that the struggle of a few moments
before would be renewed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the German soldiers sprang forward and the
prisoners became quiet again. Two men rushed
forward and threw their arms about Hal, rendering
him powerless. A third raised his rifle and brought
the stock down on Hal’s head with a crash. The
lad toppled over.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he again became conscious of what was
going on about him, he still lay on the hard and
damp ground. Above him stood a grinning guard.
Hal felt a pain in his head and passed a hand over
the spot. When he withdrew it, it was covered with
blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get up!” commanded the German guard.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal realized the necessity of immediate compliance
and staggered to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get your pick!” commanded the guard.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal obeyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now get back to work!”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no help for it, and in spite of his weakness
Hal wielded his pick with the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>At his right, Hal saw that Harding, with several
ugly wounds in his head, also was back at work.
The man smiled slightly as he caught Hal’s eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see, you started something we all couldn’t
finish,” he said in a low voice. “These Germans
have discovered the way of putting down a mutiny,
as you have learned. Of course the time may come
when we shall catch them unprepared, but it hasn’t
come yet, so lie low. Hello,” he added, “your friend
is coming to his senses. If he’s wise he’ll get up
and work till he drops.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester, under the command of the guard who
stood close to him, got to his feet and fell to work
close to Hal. The lad’s face was very pale and he
seemed in imminent danger of collapsing at any moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you stick it out, Chester?” asked Hal in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” was his chum’s reply. “I feel
pretty faint.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Silence, there!” thundered the nearest guard.
“Work; don’t talk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The prisoners worked on in silence. Each stroke
that Chester took he felt sure would be his last.
But he gritted his teeth and stuck to it, and some
way he always found the strength for one more
blow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding nodded approvingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll do,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Strange as it may seem, after another half hour’s
work Hal felt his strength returning to him. It
took less effort to wield his pick. The lad was hungry
and he felt an uncomfortable gnawing within,
but the dizziness had left him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester also began to feel better. The faintness
left and color returned to his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Six months of this work,” he whispered to Hal,
“and I’ll be able to lick your marine friend, Bowers,
without exerting myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal smiled slightly, but he drew a breath of relief.
When Chester talked like that he was not
badly hurt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What time do we quit?” Hal asked of Harding
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Usually about two o’clock,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! Don’t we knock off to eat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding allowed a wry smile to steal over his
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We do not,” he replied. “And the chances are
that as a result of the trouble here we won’t eat at
all to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal gazed at him in pure alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott!” he exclaimed. “You don’t mean
to tell me they will starve us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not quite,” was the Englishman’s reply, “but
I’ve gone three or four days at a time without a
morsel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But a man can’t work unless he eats,” declared
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe not; but the Germans are not worrying
about that. If we want to eat we’ve got to work
and make no trouble. That’s all there is about it.
Let me tell you something. I’ve seen at least twenty
men carried out of here and they are not living
now. They were simply starved to death. These
Germans will go the limit. Don’t make any mistake
about that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal turned this over in his mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” he said to himself at last, “we’re up
against it and that’s all there is about it. I am
afraid General Pershing would have done better had
he entrusted his mission to other hands. We seem
to have made a mess of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned to Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say,” he demanded in a soft voice, “what do
you suppose General Pershing would think if he
could see us now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester grinned despite his wounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess he’d think we are a pair of confounded
poor spies,” he declared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />MORE GERMAN CRUELTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>True to Harding’s prediction, there was no let-up
in the work until two o’clock that afternoon. At
that hour the German guards passed the word and
the prisoners dropped their tools and wiped moist
brows. Hal and Chester found themselves beside
Harding, the Englishman, and Mercer, the Frenchman,
once more.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now what?” asked Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Back to our holes,” replied Harding. “I mean,”
he added, catching the question in Chester’s face,
“back to the filthy little shacks where we sleep and
spend our leisure hours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Several cars now appeared along the little track
in the mine and the prisoners clambered aboard.
These then proceeded to the main shaft, where the
men were carried aloft a few at a time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not for a moment did the German guards relax
their vigilance. Rifles were held ready for instant
use. More than once they had been caught unprepared
and several times batches of prisoners had
succeeded in making their escape. Some had been
recaptured, but others had found their way back to
their own lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester were carried up in the car with
Harding and Mercer and two other British prisoners.
For some reason, both lads had decided unconsciously
to stick as close as possible to the big
Englishman, and he appeared glad of their company.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the guns of the guards, the prisoners were
marched across the open to a row of shacks in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wonder where they’ll put us, Chester?” said
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t know,” replied Chester, “but I can’t see
that it makes any difference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is room for a couple of more in my
shack,” said Harding. “You boys just walk in with
me as though you belonged there. Maybe they’ll
let you stay.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads acted on this advice and a few moments
later were in the little hovel that Harding called
home. Hal took in his surroundings with a calculating
eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was only one window, through which the
sun now streamed. There was no door beside the
one through which they had entered. Hal gave a
start of surprise when he saw that the window was
not barred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought of course they’d have bars there,” he
said, pointing. “Looks to me like a fellow might
crawl out in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you could,” returned Harding, “but that
wouldn’t help anything. There are thousands of
armed guards around this place. You wouldn’t
have much of a chance getting through.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s been tried, though, I suppose?” queried Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; and there’s a graveyard behind us that has
more occupants as a result. I believe that several
men have succeeded in getting through, but I can’t
say positively. It’s only talk among the prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Haven’t you ever thought of making a break for
liberty, Harding?” demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Englishman looked at the lad curiously. He
was silent for some moments.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me tell you something,” he said at last.
“There isn’t a prisoner in this camp who is not
thinking of escape every waking minute. Why, we
even dream about it. As a matter of fact, we
scarcely think of anything else. Every now and
then conditions become so intolerable that a man,
or a batch of men, makes the attempt. Mostly, they
have some plan in their minds, but sometimes they
simply act on the spur of the moment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding mused a moment in silence. Hal and
Chester did not interrupt him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have in mind a man named Judson,” continued
Harding at last. “He had been working in the
mines for months. He was a big, husky chap—an
Englishman. One of the guards below found particular
delight in annoying him. He was safe
enough in this, for it was apparent that Judson could
not thrash his tormentor and the other guards as
well. For days Judson bore the torment in silence
and then he could stand it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did he do?” demanded Chester eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why,” said Harding, “he simply diverted a blow
of his pick to the guard and that settled the German.
Then, before the remaining guards, who were
stunned momentarily by the suddenness of the act,
could even think, Judson was among them swinging
his pick right and left. You know,” he broke off,
“it’s funny what a little thing will raise the hopes
of every prisoner in the camp. Every man sees in
each little breach of discipline—each little mutinous
act—the opportunity for which he thinks he has been
waiting. It was so in Judson’s case.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As the guards sprang in to seize Judson, every
prisoner in sight entered the conflict. Picks and
shovels and drills were our weapons. For a moment
we made headway, the attack was so sudden.
But we didn’t have a chance. The guards turned
their rifles on us and it only took a few minutes to
quell the disorder. Five prisoners were killed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Judson, what happened to him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Harding was silent for a few moments.
Then he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frankly, I’d rather not talk about that. But
having heard so much of the story, I guess you are
entitled to the rest. You see, Judson did considerable
damage with that pick before he was overcome.
Besides the first guard, he felled three more of the
Germans before they could subdue him. They
couldn’t have done it then except that a guard closed
in from behind and shot him through the head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And killed him?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Harding, “the bullet didn’t kill him,
worse luck. It would have been better if it had.
Now comes the part I don’t like to talk about.” The
lads saw the Englishman’s great hands clench and
unclench as he talked and they knew that a terrible
anger was raging within him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What happened?” asked Hal in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why,” said Harding, “they took Judson to the
surgeon, had his wound dressed and gave him some
clean clothes. Then, the next day, right at the
mouth of the mine as the shafts changed and practically
every prisoner in the camp was there, they
killed him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester shuddered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How?” asked Hal softly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s the horrible part of it,” said Harding in
a choking voice. “They tied him to a post stuck in
the ground for that purpose. Then a score of guards
drew off twenty paces and unslung their lances.
These they then began to use as spears, hurling them
from that distance. It was plain, of course, that
they did not mean to kill Judson instantly—from
that distance there are few men who can launch a
death throw—particularly with a lance. The first
weapon struck Judson a glancing blow in the side—he
had been stripped to the waist—it was a terrible
sight.” Harding broke off again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did you stay?” demanded Hal, who was
raging furiously within as Harding proceeded with
his story.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was no help for it,” the man replied.
“We were herded there under the guns of a hundred
or more guards. Well, every lance thrown
brought cheers and jeers from the guards—but there
came never so much as a groan from Judson. I
don’t know how long it lasted—it seemed like hours,
though I suppose it was only a matter of minutes.
Pierced in scores of places, Judson at last found
eternal peace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding dropped suddenly into a little chair and
buried his face in his hands. For the moment, Hal
and Chester were too greatly shocked by this tale of
barbarism to utter a word. Chester’s hand clutched
Hal’s arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Isn’t it terrible?” he whispered. “And to think
that these men call themselves Christians!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding overheard the remark and looked up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Christians!” he echoed. “Let me tell you something.
The atrocities of the Turks in Armenia that
we have heard so much about pale into insignificance
alongside the cruelties of the Germans. Not for
nothing have they won the name ‘Hun.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor Judson!” he continued. “He was my pal.
Never shall I forget that sight. Sometimes in my
dreams I see it now, and I awake with a scream.
Now, my lads, do you wonder that while every prisoner
here is thinking of escape he hesitates to make
the attempt?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should say not!” declared Hal. “But the Huns
must answer for all this—their time of reckoning
will come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but it will not be in proportion to the punishment
they deserve,” said Harding, “and that is
what makes it so hard to bear. Cruelties that they
have inflicted upon their prisoners will not be repaid
in kind—there is no such barbarism in the hearts of
the Allied nations. But,” and Harding brought his
clenched fist into his left palm with a resounding
smack, “the debt should be paid in kind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no, Harding,” said Chester quietly. “We
cannot lower ourselves to the level of these barbarians.
Remember what the Good Book says:
‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Harding buried his face in his hands.
When he again looked up there was a more peaceful
expression in his face—his eyes had lost their hardness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are right,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Chester, turning the subject, “the
question is what they will do with us in view of the
trouble we stirred up to-day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding shrugged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s hard to tell,” he answered. “It all depends
on their mood. It may be that they will prescribe a
week or so of solitary confinement, the lash, or the
matter may be overlooked. You never can tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott!” said Hal. “We can’t stand for
solitary confinement. I must tell you something,
Harding. It is absolutely necessary that we get
away from here without delay—at least that we
make the attempt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remember the story of Judson,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it can’t be helped,” declared Chester.
“We’ll have to risk it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding looked at the lad sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean that you have some particular reason?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester nodded affirmatively, and then, in a few
words, explained the mission with which they had
been entrusted by General Pershing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can realize the necessity of haste,” declared
Harding, a strange light in his face, “and now I will
tell you something. I have considered the situation
from every angle and I believe that I have found a
plan that promises success.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have?” exclaimed Chester eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Harding, “and now that the necessity
has become so urgent we shall make the attempt
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester stifled their joy in subdued exclamations
of delight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />THE ESCAPE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The rest of the day was spent in discussing the
plan of escape; and that night Hal and Chester slept
well in spite of the fact that they were compelled to
stretch out on the hard floor and that there were no
blankets nor other clothing to keep out the early
morning chill.</p>

<p class='c005'>As upon their first day in the mines, they were
aroused before daylight and marched to the shaft.
It was still dark when they again found themselves
below and at work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester put forth their best efforts from
the first, for they did not wish to draw the attention
of the guards to them particularly and thus interfere
with Harding’s plans.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was just eleven o’clock when Harding lowered
his pick and turned to the nearest guard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad spot here, sir,” he said. “Gas. It’s dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The guard approached and sniffed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on with your work,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding made no reply, but picked up his pick
and fell to work again.</p>

<p class='c005'>A close observer might have seen him turn
slightly to the man on his right, who chanced to be
the Frenchman Mercer; a close observer might have
seen Harding’s lips move slightly, and a keener ear
than that of the nearest German guard might have
caught these words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s time, Mercer. Pass the word. Be ready in
five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mercer indicated that he understood and passed the
word quietly. To Harding’s left, Hal also passed
the word to the nearest man: “Be ready in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding had explained the day before that every
prisoner in the shaft had been taken into his confidence—that
he, having conceived the scheme, was
entitled to be the man who had the first right to
escape. This, Hal and Chester had learned, was
the unwritten law among prisoners in Germany.
Others who were in the plot would escape if it were
possible, but they must shield the man who conceived
the idea.</p>

<p class='c005'>In less than the time allowed by Harding, every
prisoner knew that the big Englishman had decided
to “go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no indication in the face of any man
that he knew something was about to happen and
so the suspicion of the guards was not aroused.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stealthily, Harding drew something from his
pocket. It was a match which he had secreted in
the lining. He drew even closer to the wall of earth
before him.</p>

<p class='c005'>There, it could be seen, he had dug a little pocket.
At this point there was a stronger smell of gas.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look out!” cried Harding suddenly.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same moment he struck the match, he
dropped his pick and shielded his face with his hand.
At the same moment, too, every prisoner covered
the glow of his safety lamp with his hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a flash and a roar, followed by the
sound of tumbling earth. Hal and Chester felt their
arms seized in a strong grip which they knew to be
that of Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came now sounds of confusion and hoarse guttural
shouts from the German guards. Behind them
the lads heard the sounds of confusion. Then they
felt themselves drawn back by Harding’s hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In here!” whispered the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester now exposed his light sufficiently to show
that the three were in what appeared to be a small
cavern leading off from the mine tunnel itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hastily, under Harding’s directions, the lads
pushed forward large lumps of ore and dirt until
now they were almost barricaded behind this fortification
and seemed safe from prying eyes without.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not too much,” said Harding. “We’ve got to
breathe, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was all the explosion?” demanded Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Harding, “when a man strikes a
match in a mine there is bound to be an explosion.
I struck the match.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that,” agreed Chester, “but how does it
happen that we are still alive? You might have
brought the whole mine in on us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve worked in mines before,” said Harding.
“These little local blasts don’t amount to much if
you keep away from the flare. However, a man
never knows when he hears the blast just how serious
it may be. That’s why the German guards are
in such confusion. I am not worried because I know
the nature of the blast, and the other prisoners are
not worried for the same reason. Hear them fight!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The sounds of the struggle carried plainly to the
ears of the three friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Somebody will be killed,” declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naturally,” said Harding quietly, “but it will be
in a good cause and they know it. Don’t mistake
me, boys; every man there knows that I am not
doing this just to try to save my own skin. The
word has been passed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has?” exclaimed Hal in surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, and I pride myself in the fact that it
was done cleverly if you didn’t see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t see anything,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither did the guards, apparently,” said Harding.
“But we had better keep quiet now. Remember,
we have long hours ahead of us here and then
work to do before we are free.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three became silent. The sounds of conflict
without continued for possibly half an hour,
then gradually died away.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the sounds of the picks were no longer heard.
There would be no more work in No. 10 level until
after the German authorities had assured themselves
that it was safe. For this purpose, of course,
an inspection would be necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll miss us, too,” whispered Hal, “and
they’ll have a look for us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And they will think they have located us when
they encounter a mass of debris near where we
stood,” said Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, caused by the blast, eh?” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; put there through Mercer’s efforts,” replied
Harding. “You see,” he explained, “we had
already dug in such a manner that a certain piece of
rock could be unloosened by a couple of quick blows.
Mercer gave them after I struck the match.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott! You seem to have had it figured
out perfectly,” declared Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I did,” replied Harding, “up to the point when
we reach the outside. After that events will have
to shape themselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But when they explore the debris out there and
don’t find us, they will smell a mouse,” declared
Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They won’t explore it right away,” declared
Harding. “The inspection of the mine itself will
come first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding proved a good prophet in this.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was perhaps 2 o’clock in the afternoon when
Hal heard footsteps approaching. The three friends
listened intently.</p>

<p class='c005'>Voices were conversing in German, and from their
refuge the lads caught the glow of safety lamps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Must be four or five of them,” declared Hal in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so,” Harding whispered back. “There
must be at least three for the success of my plan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The inspectors, for such the lads knew the Germans
to be, passed along the mine tunnel so close to
the refuge of the three friends that Hal could have
reached out and touched one of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll let ’em go by because there may be more
coming, though it is unlikely,” said Harding. “You
were right, boy, there are four of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Englishman waited until the four inspectors
had turned an angle in the tunnel, and then, quickly
removing the debris they had piled in front of them,
the three friends stepped out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Harding “we’ll get as close to that
turn as possible, and we’ll nail ’em when they come
back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They took their positions and waited in silence,
every nerve on edge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Directly the sound of footsteps were heard again
and the Germans returned, conversing and utterly
unconscious of the danger that lay in wait.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the first man appeared around the turn, Harding’s
right fist shot out and the man tumbled over.
Instantly the Englishman and Hal and Chester were
upon the other astonished inspectors.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hands up!” cried Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Germans, realizing that their opponents
were unarmed, reached for their revolvers. Hal
sprang forward and closed with the nearest German
before the man could press the trigger. The lad
staggered him with a powerful blow to the nose,
followed by a left to the chin that sent him down.
Hal then possessed himself of the man’s revolver
and turned to aid his friends should they need assistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester’s adversary had fired as the lad rushed
him, but the bullet had missed its mark. As Hal
now came to Chester’s assistance, the German held
his hands high, dropping the revolver.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding, meantime, had disposed of the fourth inspector
with promptness and dispatch, a heavy blow
behind the ear laying the man low.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quick, now,” said the Englishman. “Change
clothes with them. I’ll change with this big man
here. I guess they’ll fit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The change was made quickly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now to get out of here,” said Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three walked quickly along the tunnel to the
little mine car, which they boarded. Harding became
the motorman and the car moved off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The men at the top will wonder what has become
of the fourth inspector, won’t they?” asked Chester,
as they alighted from the mine car at the edge of
the shaft.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have to trust to luck there,” said Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three stepped in the elevator that was to
carry them aloft, and Harding gave the signal to
pull up by tugging sharply at the cable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep your caps down over your head and your
heads lowered,” Harding cautioned, as the car began
to go up.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads nodded in the semi-darkness, but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly the elevator shot out into the light and
came to a stop. From beneath their caps, the three
friends glanced sharply about them, and Chester
gave a sigh of pure relief.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the top of the mine there were, at that moment,
only three German guards and the man who
stood on watch at the elevator. The three guards
were engaged in animated conversation and
apparently were not interested in the appearance of the
car from below. There remained only the fourth
man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding stepped from the car. Hal and Chester
followed him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />FLIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Without a word Harding led the way directly
from the mine. The three German guards looked
up as the friends passed and saluted, for Harding,
Hal and Chester were all attired in German uniforms
that bore captains’ stripes. The three returned
the salutes and passed on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now what, Harding?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leave it to me,” was the reply. “I know where
there are half a dozen big automobiles, but I’m
afraid we’ll have to impress a driver into service.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do the driving,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you can drive, eh?” said Harding. “So
much the better.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Fifteen minutes’ walk brought the three friends
within sight of the spot where the automobiles were
parked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better pick that long, low car there,” whispered
Hal. “It looks as though it could show some
speed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding nodded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several guards stood about the automobiles.
They saluted as the three pseudo German officers
appeared, but said nothing. Hal climbed into the
driver’s seat of the car he had selected, while Harding
and Chester jumped into the tonneau.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let her go!” exclaimed Harding, “but slowly
unless there is some sign of suspicion. If we start
off too fast they’ll know there is something wrong.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The car moved off slowly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later they were out of sight of the
prison camp. It was then that Chester leaned forward
and touched Hal on the arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which way now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I judge that this road will take us to the Swiss
border,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are,” agreed Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trouble is,” said Chester, “that we don’t want
to get out of Germany just yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What!” exclaimed Harding.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Chester is right,” Hal put in. “You see, Harding,
we haven’t yet obtained the information we
came after.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove! So you haven’t!” exclaimed Harding.
“Well, what are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get it,” returned Hal briefly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Easily said,” he declared, “but, I am afraid, not
so easily accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you’ll listen to me I think I can suggest something,”
declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fire away,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” began Chester, “in the first place we have
a certain immunity now that we wear German uniforms.
Hal and I speak German fluently, which
will help. How about you, Harding?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very little,” was the reply. “English has always
been good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we shall have to do the talking,” said Chester.
“You will have to be afflicted with an attack of
dumbness, Harding.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can do that, all right. I’ll just sit tight and
say nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good! Now my idea is this: We’ll head for
the front, bearing off a trifle to the south and thus
dodging the Swiss border. We’ll proceed as straight
as possible to the German front in France. We’ll
trust to luck to get back to our own lines after we
have learned at the front that which we desire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t call that much of a plan,” said Harding.
“There is no strategy there. Besides, we
would just be putting our heads into the lion’s
mouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless,” said Hal, “it is only in the midst
of the German army that we can get the information
we are after.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s probably true,” said Harding. “Well,
have it your own way and count on me to the finish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll just keep going, then,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The big automobile began to pick up speed now
and directly was dashing along at a rapid gait.
From time to time they passed other cars on the
road, but they were not stopped. The very audacity
of the three friends augured toward their safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was almost dark when Hal slowed down and
stopped in front of a little hotel in a small village.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ve got to have more gas and air,” he explained,
in response to Chester’s questions. “Besides,
the engine needs a drink. It’s red hot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Also,” said Harding in a low voice, “we could
get away with a little grub.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are,” said Hal. “We shall be able to
satisfy all our needs here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three entered the hotel. The proprietor
promised that the automobile should be looked after
and ready within the hour and showed the three
fugitives to a small dining-room at the far side of
the building. The only occupant of the room at that
moment proved to be a German colonel and the
Englishman and the two American lads saluted him
stiffly. The German returned the salute and continued
his repast.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fugitives ate heartily of the plain fare placed
before them by their host. As Hal was draining
his cup of the last drop of coffee, he became conscious
that the German colonel was eyeing him.
Suddenly the man kicked back his chair and approached
the table at which the friends sat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal felt of his revolver, for he smelled trouble.
But he need not have worried—then.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are you men going?” asked the colonel
gruffly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To General von Mackensen, at the front, with
dispatches,” said Hal, mentioning the name of the
first German general he thought of.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So?” exclaimed the colonel. “I am going that
way myself, also with dispatches. I find, however,
that I shall have to remain here until morning unless
I can commandeer a passing automobile.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal thought rapidly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you, sir,” he said at length, “we are going
on to-night, and we shall be glad to have you
accompany us, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall be glad,” said the colonel. “When shall
you start?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Immediately, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good! I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal now introduced himself by a fictitious name;
also his companions. The colonel owned up to the
name of Reissler. Together the four left the hotel
and returned to the automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you will ride in front with me, I shall be honored,
sir,” said Hal to the colonel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad had reason for this. He intended to do
all the talking done by the fugitives. He felt certain
that should the colonel ride with Harding and
Chester he must certainly discover that Harding was
an imposter. Of Chester, however, he had no fear,
for Chester’s command of the German tongue was
as perfect as Hal’s own.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Colonel,” said Hal, as he started the car, “I
have been long in the east and am not altogether
familiar with the roads here. You will perhaps
point out the shortest route as we go along?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course,” said the colonel. “By the way,” he
added, “have you an idea of the nature of your dispatches?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal hesitated. He could not be sure of his
ground and he was at a loss what to say. However,
he knew that the German colonel would require
an answer, so he took a long chance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not exactly sure, sir,” he replied, “but I
believe that they have something to do with a possible
retirement of our troops all along the western front.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The colonel looked at him sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean a realignment, sir?” he said sharply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, yes, sir,” returned Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The colonel’s face lost its sternness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My understanding is similar to yours,” he said.
“We all know, of course, that our losses have been
very heavy in the last few months—particularly in
the last attempt to break through at Ypres. I’ll tell
you something,” and he leaned forward, “had the
Allied armies, reinforced as they have been by
American troops, followed up our defeat there, we
would have been compelled to fall back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, sir,” said Hal, “this is news to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it is,” returned the colonel. “Yet it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal now became convinced of something he had
begun to suspect since the moment the colonel became
so talkative. The man had been drinking. In
no other way could the lad account for his condescension
in conversing with an officer beneath him
in rank. Also, when the man leaned toward him,
Hal could catch the odor of his breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove!” the lad told himself. “It may be that
luck has turned our way at last. If I could get
hold of those dispatches he carries I might learn
something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To the colonel he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you on your way to General von Mackensen’s
quarters, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am,” was the reply. “Now I’ll tell you something
more. Between the two of us, I am getting
tired of this war; I wish it would come to an end.
We know we can’t win, you and I, and so does every
member of the staff. Why, our ranks have been so
depleted that it takes wonderful generalship to make
the enemy believe we are still impregnable in our
present positions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is that so, sir?” said Hal. “I had no idea it
was as bad as that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only the other day,” continued the colonel, “I
chanced to be in Berlin. The emperor was there at
the time, in conference with Generals Ludendorff,
von Mackensen and Hindenburg. I, as you know,
am on von Mackensen’s staff. Now let me tell you
what I heard old Hindenburg himself say. ‘Your
Majesty,’ said he, ‘we’ve got to continue our attacks,
for when we stop the enemy will begin his.
By our attacks we must keep from him the fact that
we could not resist an offensive on a large scale.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Himmel! That does sound bad,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does, indeed. Now, in my dispatches are contained
practically those same words from Hindenburg—practically
a repetition of the reasons he advanced
at the conference, urging further attacks.
Also I carry a description of the disposition of our
troops and other material that Hindenburg hopes
will convince von Mackensen that we must continue
the offensive at all costs. Bad? I should say it is!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s heart leaped into his throat. Here was
luck, indeed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THROUGH THE LINES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Hal turned the matter over in his mind. Should
he make prisoner of this talkative German officer
now or should he wait until later to appropriate the
dispatches the man said he carried?</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal decided to wait.</p>

<p class='c005'>He did this for two reasons. First, the colonel’s
presence was useful right now in showing the road,
and, second, he might come in handy should the
party be stopped en route. So the lad decided to
humor the man by continuing the conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s too bad, sir,” he said. “Why, I can remember
in the early days of the war when the emperor
figured on eating Christmas dinner in Paris. It’s
too bad, sir; too bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it is,” agreed the colonel, “but personally,
I’m getting tired of this business of killing. It’s so
useless, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those are bold words, sir,” said Hal; “bold and
not overly cautious, should they come to some ears.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you agree with me, don’t you, captain?”
exclaimed the colonel, in some alarm. “I am talking
now between friends, you know. Surely you
will not repeat what I have just said?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly I shall not repeat to any German officer
what you have said,” Hal declared truthfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this moment the car rounded a sharp curve in
the road. Ahead Hal saw the headlight of a machine
drawn up in the middle of the road. It was
impossible for the lad to drive around the second
machine, so he brought his own car to a stop.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hope there is no trouble ahead,” he told himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, as it developed, there was trouble ahead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal sprang from the car, as did Harding and
Chester. The three realized that if there was
trouble it would be better for them to stick together.
The German colonel, however, leaned back in his
seat, making no effort to move.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half a dozen figures advanced toward the three
fugitives, five privates and a lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lieutenant saluted Hal, who was in advance,
as did the privates.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal returned the salute.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What can I do for you, lieutenant?” he asked.
“Machine in trouble?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir. I’m guarding the road in the hope of
picking up three prisoners who escaped from the
camp at Villingen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see,” said Hal. “Word flashed ahead, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir, and it was deemed probable they would
come along this road.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t seen anything of them en route,” said
Hal. “It may be that they are behind us. Wish you
luck, lieutenant. Sorry I can’t stay and have a
hand in the capture, but I bear important dispatches
and must be on my way. Will you please move your
car to one side of the road?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sorry, sir,” said the lieutenant, “but I am instructed
to examine carefully every one who passes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, well, I suppose I can drive around you,” said
Hal, eyeing the side of the road.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One moment, sir,” said the lieutenant as Hal
turned to move away. “I am satisfied with you, sir,
but I must interrogate your companions. Remember,
it is my duty, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, then, lieutenant,” said Hal. “Proceed,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester approached and replied to the German’s
questions without hesitancy. Then Harding was
forced to step forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>One look at the big Englishman was enough for
the German lieutenant. Nevertheless, he spoke in
German.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I ask your name, Herr Captain?” he said.
Harding opened his mouth to reply, but at that
moment Hal took prompt action. Stepping close to
the German lieutenant, he shoved his revolver
against the man’s side and said quietly:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Enough of this, sir. You will either order your
men to move that automobile from across the road
immediately, or I shall be compelled to fire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The German’s face turned a chalky white in the
darkness, although this was not distinguishable.
For a moment he hesitated, but Hal shoved the revolver
more closely against him and the lieutenant
gave the necessary command.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now Chester,” said Hal, “you and Harding go
back and get in the car, and whatever you do, make
sure that our friend the colonel doesn’t get out.
He’s a jewel of rare value, Chester, and we can’t
afford to lose him. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet,” was Chester’s reply, as he and Harding
turned and ran for the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German colonel was about to alight as Chester
and Harding dashed back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the trouble?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing serious, sir,” said Chester. “Please get
back in the car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait a moment now,” protested the colonel.
“Guess I’ll have a look ahead first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get back in that car!” said Chester in a stern
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here!” exclaimed the colonel. “How dare
you talk like that to your superior officer? You
shall be disciplined, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No time for words,” said Harding in English
at that moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>He ran in suddenly and seized the colonel from
behind. In spite of the latter’s frantic struggles, the
Englishman lifted him into the tonneau and held
him as he climbed in himself. Chester also jumped
in and showed a revolver, which he pressed close
to the colonel’s head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One word and you are a dead man!” said the
lad quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal, still guarding the German lieutenant closely,
saw the German privates move the machine and
open the road.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, lieutenant,” he said, “you’ll accompany
me back to my own car, first ordering your men to
stand one side.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lieutenant gave the necessary order and preceded
Hal back to the other car.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One more thing, lieutenant,” said Hal, as he
placed his foot on the step prepared to leap in, “if
you make an outcry before we have passed your
men yonder, some of them will get hurt. Take my
advice and keep still.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal lowered his revolver slowly until it pointed
at the German’s feet. Then he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a flash and a report and the German
lieutenant skipped nimbly back as the bullet kicked
up the dust about him. He was not wounded, nor
had Hal intended that he should be. The lad’s act
was simply a ruse to get a little start.</p>

<p class='c005'>The moment he fired his revolver Hal leaped into
the car, slammed the door behind him and sent the
machine forward with a lurch.</p>

<p class='c005'>From behind came an angry hail from the lieutenant
and his revolver cracked. But the bullets
went wild.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lieutenant’s action, however, had served his
purpose. It alarmed the soldiers ahead, who, seeing
the automobile bearing down on them, cried loud
commands to halt.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the car kept on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Duck!” cried Hal, and suited the action to the
word.</p>

<p class='c005'>The occupants of the tonneau also ducked their
heads out of harm’s way even as the German soldiers
fired a volley from their rifles. Before they
could fire again, however, the car was far down the
road, and a moment later it disappeared around a
sharp curve.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’ll be pursuit, Chester!” shouted Hal.
“Rifle the pockets of our friend the colonel and
climb in the front seat here with whatever you can
find.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester needed no further instructions.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of the protests and struggles of the German
colonel, Chester went through his pockets systematically
and thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now you guard him, Harding,” the lad said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll guard him all right,” said Harding grimly.
“I’ll toss him overboard at the first sign of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The German appeared to understand the words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester climbed into the front seat with some difficulty
because of the lurching of the car as it sped
along. In a few words Hal told him of the dispatches
the colonel had carried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If he had ’em, I’ve got ’em now,” said Chester
grimly. “I took everything he had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can’t stop to see now,” said Hal. “You
climb back and tell him we are figuring on him to
show us the way to the front direct. If he refuses
or plays false, tell him you’ll shoot him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester clambered back into the tonneau again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I agree!” shouted the colonel when Chester told
him what he would be expected to do. “And I’ll
do better than that. I don’t want to fight any more.
I’m tired of it. I am your prisoner, sir, and I wish
to be taken into your lines as such.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That sounds pretty fishy to me,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it is true,” protested the German, “and I will
show you the way through the German lines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was something so apparently sincere in the
German’s words, that Chester climbed back and
again held counsel with Hal. The result of this was
that the German colonel was transferred to the front
seat, and Chester sat close behind him with a revolver
at his back.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was hours later that the automobile came within
sight of the huge German army encampment. Hal
was now forced to slow down.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the party was not molested as the car proceeded
through the heart of the encampment, Hal
following the directions of the German colonel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said the colonel, pointing, “if you will
follow that road, it will take us to the front line,
where, by a dash, we shall be able to pass the last
outposts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal followed the directions. Ten minutes later
a German sentinel cried a command to halt, but Hal
sent the car forward faster. There came a sharp
report from behind, but the bullet went wild.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later there came another command
to halt. But this command came in English.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal brought the car to a quick stop and climbed
out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Safe at last,” he cried to Chester and Harding.
“And now for General Pershing and the drive that
will push the Germans back forever!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />PROMOTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>As Hal jumped from the automobile, he found his
way barred by a British sentinel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s all right; we’re friends,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Briton eyed Hal and his German uniform
dubiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may be,” he said, “but the uniform you
wear doesn’t look much like it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are friends nevertheless,” he said. “Take
us to your colonel and we’ll convince him soon
enough.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the Tommy, “you may be. I’ve seen
some queer things in this war so I’ll not dispute you.
But I’ll take my oath that man,” and he pointed to
the German colonel, “is a German.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re right, my man,” said Hal, “but he comes
as a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you’ll all go to the colonel as prisoners,”
declared the sentinel. He raised his voice in a
shout: “Hey, sergeant!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A British sergeant came forward at a run.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter, Smith?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Four chaps here in German uniforms and three
of ’em say they belong to our army,” said Smith.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sergeant looked the four over. As his eyes
fell on Harding he started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll take my oath it’s Harding!” he exclaimed,
and advanced with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are sergeant,” said Harding. “How
do you like my new uniform?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fine, if you killed a Boche to get it,” the sergeant
made reply. He turned to the colonel. “I’ll
be responsible for these men, Smith,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>The private walked away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding explained the situation to the sergeant
in a few words, leaving out, however, all reference
to the lads’ mission.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll wake the colonel myself,” said the sergeant,
“if you say you must be on your way at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must, sergeant,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well then; follow me, but you there, Mr.
Fritz, walk ahead and remember I’ve got my gun
ready and would be glad to use it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In this manner they reached the quarters of the
British regimental commander, who received Hal
and Chester immediately when he learned that there
was need of haste.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We carry dispatches for General Pershing, sir,”
said Hal, “and we would like to be on our way at
once. Otherwise we would not have disturbed you
at this hour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your names?” asked the colonel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” said the colonel. “I shall get in
touch with General Pershing immediately by telephone.
In the meantime, you must remain here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The colonel summoned his orderly and gave the
necessary instructions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harding, meantime, had gone away with his
friend the top sergeant, who also had volunteered
to take care of the German officer. The boys had
promised Harding that they would see him again
before they left. He had announced his intention
of joining his own regiment.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was several hours later—after daylight—when
the British colonel informed the lads that they were
at liberty to depart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have satisfied myself of your identity,” he
told them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder, sir,” said Hal, “if you could supply
us with more appropriate clothing than these German
uniforms?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think I can,” he replied. “It’s true you
wouldn’t make much progress in our lines with those
uniforms. Also I can furnish you a British army
automobile, which will help.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later they were attired in
regulation British uniforms and stood talking to Harding
just before they made ready to climb into the automobile
to continue their journey.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am certainly glad we ran across you, Harding,”
said Hal as the two shook hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No more than I am to have been with you both,
sir,” said Harding. “I wish you luck in the matter
you told me of and I feel that the offensive now will
not be long coming. In the meantime, however, in
accord with your wishes, I shall say nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure it will be better that way,” said Hal.
“Well, we’ll see you again some time. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester also bade the Englishman farewell and
the two boys climbed into the machine. The car
sped forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a long distance to General Pershing’s headquarters
in Soissons from the point where Hal and
Chester had re-entered the Allied lines, and Hal
knew that he could not hope to cover the distance
before dark. Nevertheless, he kept the car going
at a fair speed all during the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads made only two stops, both times to replenish
their gasoline tank, but it was well after
eight o’clock that evening when they came to the
outskirts of Soissons.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal slowed down the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, we’ll soon be there,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I’ll be glad of it,” declared Chester. “It’s
been quite an eventful trip and we’ve learned a few
things about the enemy that we didn’t know before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” said Hal. “By the way, did you examine
the papers we took from the German to make
sure that they were what he said?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. I have the dispatch, and it is as he represented
it to be. I made sure of that, all right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good; then our mission has been successful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has if Marshal Foch lives up to his word,”
said Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’ll do that, all right. You heard him make
the promise, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; but maybe he’ll say this is not sufficient
proof.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He can’t very well, to my mind. Hello, here we
are!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The car came to a pause in front of the villa occupied
by General Pershing. The two lads climbed
out.</p>

<p class='c005'>As they would have ascended the steps, they were
stopped by an American sentry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have word sent to General Pershing that Lieutenants
Paine and Crawford are here to report,”
said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man passed the word to a second sentinel,
who entered the building. He was back in a few
moments.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The general directs that you come to him immediately,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester mounted the steps rapidly,
passed through the long hall and entered General
Pershing’s private office.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing stood close to the door as the
lads entered, and there was an expression of eagerness
on his face. The lads saluted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What luck?” demanded the American commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The best, sir,” replied Hal quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good!” thundered the American commander.
“I knew you would do it. Now tell me what you
have learned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal related the incidents leading up to the seizure
of the German officer’s dispatches as briefly as possible
and Chester passed over the papers.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing hurried to his desk and beneath
the glow of his desk light ran through the papers
quickly. A smile stole over his features.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is enough,” he said, getting to his feet again.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Paine, Captain Crawford,” said General
Pershing. “I congratulate you both. You have
done well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester started at the title of “captain”
and Hal would have spoken. But General Pershing
stayed him with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your promotions I made out before you started,”
he said simply. “It would have been no disgrace
had you failed. I understand you were captains in
the British army before you resigned to go to America
and fight for Old Glory. Surely your own country
is bound to treat you as well as England.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The faces of both boys were red and they fidgeted
nervously. The praise of their general pleased them,
but they would rather have done without it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” muttered Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester also stammered his gratitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will say this much more,” continued General
Pershing; “You are young for captains, it is true,
but if before the war is over you do not rank still
higher I am a bad prophet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again the lads stammered their thanks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind the thanks, sirs,” said General
Pershing. “I have bestowed no favor. You have
won your promotions on your merits. Now leave
me, for I have work to do. Report to Colonel Gibson,
who will find quarters for you for the night.
I shall send for you to-morrow. Good night, sirs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Pershing stepped toward them and extended
his hand to each in turn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal and Chester stopped at the door long enough
to salute, and then left the room. They found Colonel
Gibson without difficulty and that officer immediately
dispatched an orderly to find them quarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Hal, when they were comfortably
installed half an hour later, “I intend to sleep until
General Pershing sends for me to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I,” agreed Chester. “I don’t feel as if I
had had a good sleep for a month. And I’ll bet we
won’t get much more sleep, either.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why?” demanded Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why?” echoed Chester. “Why, because an advance
will be ordered soon and then there won’t be
time to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may not come for some weeks yet,” Hal demurred.
“Those things take time, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that,” Chester admitted, “but I’ll bet
General Pershing won’t let any grass grow under
his feet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trouble is, it’s not up to him entirely,” said
Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe not,” declared Chester, “but if Marshal
Foch doesn’t act on this information. General Pershing
is likely to act himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if he doesn’t,” laughed Hal, “one of our
divisional commanders is likely to do it in the heat
of excitement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And that is exactly what happened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />THE MARINES MOVE FORWARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Chester,” said Hal, “that is the finest looking
body of men I have ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal eyed the long lines of marines with pride and
a critical eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are, Hal,” Chester agreed. “I’ll bet
they make the Germans sit up and take notice.”
He turned to Bowers. “You are to be congratulated
on being a part of such an outfit, sergeant,”
he added.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And we’re in luck to have been detailed here at
this time,” said Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re right again,” declared Chester.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was three days after Hal and Chester had returned
from their mission for General Pershing.
Soon after the American commander had communicated
to Marshal Foch the results of the lads’
work, he had ordered them south to General Bundy’s
two divisions of marines, which for several
days had been encamped some distance from the
front. The lads had delivered dispatches from the
American commander-in-chief to General Bundy and
had been detailed to the Sixth Regiment. There,
much to their surprise, they encountered their old
friends, Lieutenants Smith and Jenkins, and Bowers,
who had been promoted to a top sergeancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>All were delighted with the reunion and the marines
expressed their satisfaction when they learned
Hal and Chester had been promoted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s probably a bit irregular to have you with
us, sir,” Sergeant Bowers said to Hal, “but we’re
glad you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you something, sergeant,” said Hal, with
a knowing wink. “It will be only a matter of hours
now until we move to the front.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is that so, sir?” asked Bowers. “Well, it can’t
be too soon for me. I’ve had one crack at these
Huns, but up to date the marines haven’t been in
sufficient strength to show what we can do. But,”
and his eyes swept the large encampment, “there are
enough of us here to run Fritz to death if they give
us a chance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Practically eighteen thousand men,” Chester
agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s hope we get another crack at them soon,
sir,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chance was to come sooner than even Hal
or Chester had believed possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was on the evening of June 15 that the
marines suddenly received orders to march. This was
the day following the arrival of Hal and Chester at
General Bundy’s headquarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lads had been much impressed with General
Bundy upon sight; and he was not to lose caste in
their eyes; for, as it developed, here was the man
who was to be mainly responsible for the launching
of the great Allied offensive.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Omar Bundy was tall and spare and was
chiefly distinguishable by a rather prominent mustache.
He was a capable officer and a man prone
to prompt decision, as he was to prove.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hard upon the orders to move forward, the marines
vaulted into camions, or French motor trucks.
These vehicles found great favor in their eyes. The
springs are so staunch and stiff, the hard seats are
so dependable, and their capacity is so blindly ignored
when they are loaded that the soldiers had
many a laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although they had had no supper, there was quite
a lot of singing as the troops embarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>All night long the trucks bumped over the traffic-torn
roads. When dawn peeped above the purple
horizon they pulled into a little French village and
the men jumped from the tracks. They were hungry
and thirsty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Up to this time the men had not thought much
about their destination, but as the roar of the guns
at the front became louder and louder they began to
realize that there was serious work ahead. In spite
of their growing thirst and the emptiness in their
stomachs, however, there was not a murmur of protest
in the ranks.</p>

<p class='c005'>A division cannot be moved over one road and
expect to reach its destination in proper formation—and
there were two divisions moving here. All
the roads leading to the destination must be utilized,
and even then some parts of the division will be
dumped many kilometers from their destination.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the troops hiked and hiked till the roads beneath
them rose in dusty protest at the ceaseless
tramp, tramp.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the afternoon the regiment to which Hal and
Chester were attached struck through a deep wood.
The trees were magnificent. All the underbrush
had been cleared out. It was replaced by shells.
Acres on acres were piled high with shells of every
calibre. Most of them were made in America, and
the troops cheered as they recognized the trade
marks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Around the edges of this stupendous mountain
of death there was a feverish activity, a subdued
excitement that boded ill. American and French
ammunition trains came tearing, galloping, whirling
in dust-clouds ahead of smoking exhausts—into that
trembling woods. With seeming recklessness shells
were tossed into the wagons and camions, which departed
with fresh haste.</p>

<p class='c005'>A flood of giant trucks streamed into the woods,
dumped their loads of ammunition and whirled away
for more. The marines tightened their belts and
decided to stick around. There was something doing!</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally the marines emerged onto the main road.
And what a road! It was a nightmare, a thousand
bedlams. There was noise, noise and more noise.
It was a Niagara of sound that deafened the men.</p>

<p class='c005'>The shouting of the workers, the crunch and
grind of wheels, the groan of gears, the cracking of
whips, the clang of metal, the pounding of countless
horses’ hoofs, the chugging of streams of motors
and the screams of their many-throated sirens;
empty ammunition trains going and loaded ones
coming, light artillery and heavy artillery, tanks in
platoons, trucks in companies, field kitchens, water
wagons, supply trains, ration carts, all fought for
space and air in order to make their own particular
noise vibrate. Every square foot of that road, broad
and gummy-surfaced, supported something all the
time, while the ditches on either side were used by
endless lines of plodding Americans, faint from
hunger and thirst, almost exhausted from want of
sleep, but all thrilled by the hunger for Huns that
would only be satisfied by victory and peace.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines were about to strike the enemy and
they knew it. Marshal Foch was behind them.</p>

<p class='c005'>So they plodded on and on without complaint.
The road with its babel of streaming traffic told
them that something was about to happen. And
each man secretly congratulated himself on being
considered good enough to have a part in the show.</p>

<p class='c005'>Toward the evening it was pure agony for most
of the men to pass a French kitchen, located in the
woods that flanked both sides of the woods. The
men took to robbing the water wagons as they
passed. French drivers, angered, slashed at them
with their whips, but the marines didn’t mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Looking back along the road, Sergeant Bowers
saw a young marine with a loaf of French bread.
The sergeant stepped out of line and waited for him.
In the presence of that loaf of bread, the sergeant
actually trembled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’d you get it?” demanded the sergeant of
the young marine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frenchman, for the makin’s,’” returned the
youngster.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly the sergeant turned his eyes to the side
of the road, where for the first time he noted the
presence, at irregular intervals, of French soldiers,
most of them slightly wounded, some of whom carried
loaves of bread. Sergeant Bowers approached
one and exposed a sack half full of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For one loaf,” he said to a Frenchman near him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without haggling, the man passed the loaf of
bread to the sergeant and the latter gave him his
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pretty high,” said the sergeant to himself, “but
I’ve just naturally got to have something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Congestion soon halted the line as the Americans
advanced. Lured on by Sergeant Bowers’ action,
hundreds of privates were able to make exchanges
with French soldiers, and it took sharp orders from
the officers to make them move on again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every now and then the marines came to a place
where a shell had exploded in the road recently. At
one place they came upon what had been five horses,
and a part of another, and some blue helmets. These
were dragged aside hastily.</p>

<p class='c005'>Around 5 o’clock, Hal, who had gone to headquarters
in a commandeered automobile, rejoined
his regiment, which soon stopped for a rest. Sergeant
Bowers dropped down in the ditch and eased
his pack straps from the spots that ached. Hal went
over to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sergeant,” said the lad, “have the men got emergency
rations?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” exclaimed Hal. “Why haven’t they?
Major Drew told me they had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, they haven’t, sir,” repeated Bowers dryly.
“I can vouch for that. I’ve had to pull up my belt
a couple of notches.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, that’s pretty tough,” declared Hal. “But
I am afraid it can’t be helped now, sergeant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right you are, sir. I don’t hear any kicking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a brief rest, the marines resumed their journey.
They struck out along a quieter road. They
hiked and hiked till their shoes quit squeaking. The
road gradually became deserted. Soon the marching
marines were the only men in sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men zig-zagged from side to side, ducking
trees cut off by big shells. Suddenly the vanguard
was confronted by a gesticulating Frenchman, who
waved his hands for them to stop. Hal halted his
company and rode forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter?” he demanded in French.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Frenchman pointed dramatically along the
road.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Boche!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” queried Hal. “<i>Com bien kilometers?</i>”
(How many kilometers?)</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Non. Non!</i>” returned the Frenchman. “Kilometer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal thanked the Frenchman and discreetly ordered
his men into a woods. The withdrawal was
assisted by five German shells that burst on both
sides of the road.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just in time, sir,” said Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right,” replied Hal, “thanks to the Frenchman.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />THE ADVANCE CONTINUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A runner found Major Drew and delivered an
order to dig in.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile, darkness had blotted out all but the
trees, and between the bark of the “heavies” (heavy
artillery), the marines caught the deep-throated roll
of thunder. A soldier who has had two months of
open work or outdoor warfare, in which artillery
had played the leading role, has to be very tired to
ignore an order to dig in a scant kilometer back of
the first line, the worst spot on the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines dug in.</p>

<p class='c005'>When nature’s storm broke the troops meekly
rolled up in their ponchos, dropped to the ground
and asleep. The closing misery of that day came in
the shape of rain. But it did not keep the tired
marines awake.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before dawn next morning, the troops were up,
standing by, awaiting the barrage. The last tanks
that had found shelter in the woods the preceding
day had trundled away before dawn. Nothing was
now left to divert the attention of the men from
gnawing stomachs. The men tightened their belts
again and tried to concentrate on the work to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>At four-thirty o’clock in the morning there was
an explosion. It never wavered. It lasted for hours
without interruption. The earth shook up and down
and sideways. The very foundation of the Teutonic
dynasties must have trembled. It shook the leaves
off the trees.</p>

<p class='c005'>Forgotten were parched throats and empty stomachs.
The troops fairly revelled in the cannonading,
for they felt that they would soon have a hand
in the fight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later, the guns still thundering, the
marines started up the road on which the Frenchman
had flagged Hal the night before. A hundred
yards beyond where he had encountered the marines
lay a dead German. Near him was a machine
gun placed to command that road.</p>

<p class='c005'>This road was a replica of other roads. If anything,
the congestion was worse than it had been
the day before.</p>

<p class='c005'>Huge trees, uprooted by giant shells, required detours
while the engineers worked like beavers to
clear away the massive tops. Reserve tanks and
artillery lined either side of the road. Ambulances
now mixed with the various wagons of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Weaving in and out through the traffic came the
walking wounded; Germans bearing improvised
stretchers and batches of from ten to twenty prisoners.
The air was peopled with aeroplanes. The
sharp chatter of machine guns occasionally rose
above the rumble of the artillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>In their first encounter of any moment with the
Boche the marines learned many things. They
learned that the German infantry had a horror of
hand-to-hand fighting, and would run or surrender
rather than try such combat. They learned that
the sole protection of the Boche artillery lay in the
effectiveness of front-line machine guns and its own
accuracy. They came to believe the backbone of the
German infantry was its artillery. Such a situation
in any army, they knew, must have a demoralizing
effect. The infantry should be the backbone of the
artillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meantime the American battalion to which Hal
and Chester were attached took up a position at the
edge of the woods and awaited orders. After the
first excitement had passed, the attention of the
troops fell back to their empty stomachs. They
counted again the hours since their last meal. They
totalled forty-two. For that many years, it seemed,
they had been without food, sleep and water rations,
and had worked as men had never worked before.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the miracle happened. A big truck drew up
by the roadside and began to dump boxes—boxes
of canned beef, tomatoes, prunes and bread. Fifteen
minutes later there were a thousand happy
marines in that section, ravenously gulping down a
real “feed” and quenching their thirst.</p>

<p class='c005'>But war considers no man’s pleasure. In the
midst of the feast came the rattle and clatter of
machine guns, temporarily acting as aerial defense.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came sweeping down from the sky four aeroplanes,
directly over where Hal and Chester stood
conversing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Iron Cross!” cried Sergeant Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the command of their officers, the men
grabbed their rifles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold on!” cried one, as the men were about to
fire at the nearest machine. “It’s a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was true, but it became apparent a moment
later that there still would be need for weapons, for
in the wake of the French craft followed three German
machines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Points in aerial battle at close range come and go
too quickly for recognition almost.</p>

<p class='c005'>The clever Frenchman was outwitting the Boche
pilot. The four planes whirled directly over the
heads of the marines, a hundred feet from the
ground, the Frenchman a few yards ahead and
lowest. They cleared the tops of the trees and
circled over a field ahead. The Boches poured lead
upon the handicapped Frenchman, who desperately
turned the nose of his craft upward. The Germans
must have been looking for such a move. They elevated
and closed in on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>A fierce battle of machine guns; a plane dropped
nose foremost. Straight down it came, then—within
twenty feet of the ground—the French pilot,
with superb daring, jerked his machine to a level
keel and sailed off, clipping the heads off the grain.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German machines hovered over the spot
where it seemed the French pilot must meet disaster,
and the marines opened fire on them with their
rifles. Each time the Germans approached closer,
they were driven off, for it was certain that an
American bullet sooner or later must find a vital
spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German machines turned and made off.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now came orders for the marines to dig in. Soon
every man had a hole. Later in the day these holes
were abandoned and the marines marched to positions
nearer the front line.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal’s detachment came to a crossroad and turned
to the right. From there the lad could see the broad
expanse of country beyond. It was all fields of waving
grain, streams of men, of horses and artillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>They cut across an enormous field of wheat. On
their right lay a French plane, apparently none the
worse for its adventure. To the left lay a big German
plane. Beside it were the bodies of two men—the
pilot and the gunner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here they come!” shouted Sergeant Bowers suddenly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal looked ahead and saw a column of
men—Germans—marching toward the Americans four
abreast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Apparently there was no end to that column.
At least twenty officers were at the head of it. They
appeared to be the happiest men in sight, and well
they might be, for for them the days of war were
over. They were prisoners.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines moved forward again.</p>

<p class='c005'>They passed a line of batteries, famous French
“75’s,” pounding, pounding. Over the country
ahead, Hal counted five hangars, or what had been
aeroplane hangars. Now they were grotesquely
twisted steel skeletons, deserted by the enemy. The
troops passed through a small village, into another
wheat field, formed for attack, and halted.</p>

<p class='c005'>They occupied a knoll. On the slope below was
a line of queer looking dots. In the hollow proper
were three “75” batteries. Up to the left were still
more batteries. Hal searched the landscape with his
eyes carefully. Ahead he saw his target.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was on the farthest hill. The last rays of the
sun outlined it clearly. It was the long line of
tanks, which the Huns had brought into the fight as
substitutes, their artillery having been captured.
When Hal first sighted them they were spitting fire
from their one-pounders and they were moving.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later, under the fire from Americans
and French, they were in ruins, and through
glasses Hal and Chester saw the German infantry
retiring past them. The French and American batteries
rested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Hal to Chester, “if you ask me, here
is where we should continue our advance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester shrugged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems that Marshal Foch has not decided yet
that the time for an offensive is ripe,” he replied.
“At the same time, I am not convinced that we
should attack right now. The two divisions of marines
are somewhat scattered, as you know, and are
not in position to give each other the necessary support.
Then, too, we must be greatly outnumbered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What difference does that make?” Hal wanted
to know. “They’re running now, aren’t they?
What’s the matter with pushing them a little
faster?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to recommend you as General Pershing’s
successor,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is that so?” demanded Hal. “Let me tell you
that it wasn’t so long ago I heard you advance ideas
that you believed were better than any that had occurred
to the general staff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess we’ll both make a couple of good generals
some day,” he said. “But all joking aside, do
you know just where we are now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, about,” said Hal. “This is Belleau Woods.
Beyond there,” and the lad pointed directly ahead,
“is what is known as Chateau Thierry. A city has
sprung up around the old chateau, but I don’t know
whether the Germans have left anything of it. It
was rather a famous spot in its day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was to become still more famous, though
neither lad knew it then.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />BUNDY’S FAMOUS MESSAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was the morning of the seventeenth of June.
All night the duel of great guns had raged over
Belleau Woods and to the north and the south.</p>

<p class='c005'>With the coming of daylight, the Germans
charged the combined French and American troops
that held that part of the field. Fighting desperately,
the Allied armies were forced to fall back in
the face of superior numbers and a terrific rain of
machine gun and artillery fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the Allied right flank and again on the left
flank the retirement of French troops began to take
on the form of a disorderly retreat. It seemed that
the day was lost.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly, in the early morning, there came pushing
through the retreating French forces, a body
of men in khaki, in perfect formation. Behind them
came others.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Bordeau, the French divisional commander,
eyed them in surprise. Hastily he dispatched
a courier to the American commander,
General Omar Bundy. The courier made the journey
quickly. General Bundy received him at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“General Bordeau advises that you fall back at
once, sir,” said the courier. “It is folly to advance
in the face of utter annihilation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General Bundy got slowly to his feet His face
was stern and his eyes flashed as he delivered his
now famous message.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We regret, sir,” said he, “that we are unable to
follow the counsels of our masters the French, but
the American flag has been compelled to retire. This
is unendurable, and none of our soldiers would understand
not being asked to do whatever is necessary
to reëstablish a situation which is humiliating to us
and unacceptable to our country’s honor. We are
going to counter attack!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And counter attack the Americans did, led by the
marines, with a result that the whole world knows.</p>

<p class='c005'>That the reader may be better able to understand
the situation, it will be well to go back a ways and
tell in more detail of events leading up to the presence
of the marines in Belleau Woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>After having been drilled all summer, the regiment
of marines which had come with the first convoy
in June, was withdrawn from the First Division.
Although this was most depressing to every
officer and man, in that it meant that they would not
be among the first in the trenches, the service to
which they were assigned was in one sense a
compliment to qualities which are as inseparable from
them as their gallantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines have traditions, associated with
ship’s orderliness, which are kept up by competent,
veteran non-commissioned officers, that make them
models in soldierly deportment.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the withdrawal of the marines, the First
Division was brought up to full strength as a complete
regular division composed of the Sixteenth,
Eighteenth, Twenty-sixth and Twenty-eighth Regiments
of infantry and the first artillery brigade, of
the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh artillery regiments.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the third of June the German confined his attacks
for the most part northward of the section
held by the marines, but was feeding in machine
gun groups with a view to future mischief. On the
early morning of the fourth, the marines took over
from the French a twelve-mile front, with the Third
brigade, holding the Fourth from its left to the west
of Belleau Woods. The Twenty-Third Regiment,
and the marine battalion and the Fifth Machine Gun
Battalion, which had been sent to fill the gap at Colombs,
were returned to the division, which now
held the sector alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines now held twelve miles of battleline
with no reserves between them and the Marne.</p>

<p class='c005'>From Hill 204 all the way to the American right
the Germans had the advantage of observation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The country is uneven, with many woods and the
usual open fields between woods and villages. In
front of the marines the Germans held the important
tactical point of the village of Bouresches and
the railroad station, and they had filtered into the
adjoining Belleau Woods and around it as an ideal
cover for machine-gun nests. This Bouresches-Belleau
line was excellent for the purpose of the enemy
if they were to stabilize their positions and cease to
advance, or as a jumping-off place for continuing
their offensive.</p>

<p class='c005'>The spirit of rivalry between the Third (a regular
brigade) and the Fourth (the marines) was very
pronounced. Marine officers might not have had
the schooling in tactics of the regulars, but being
plain infantrymen, they considered at least that they
were not afraid to fight.</p>

<p class='c005'>The honor and future of the marine corps were at
stake there before Belleau Woods and Bouresches.
There had been people who had said the marine
corps should be eliminated from the armed forces
of the United States. The marines soon were to
prove themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the Fourth of June, the first day they were in
the front line, the marines had repulsed a German
attack. At dawn on the morning of the Sixth, the
second day after they were in the line, they made an
attack in conjunction with the French on the left
to rectify the line in the direction of Torcy; and
they went through machine-gun fire and shell fire
to their objectives all according to pattern.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to General Bundy’s ideas, the way to
act in an active sector was to be active, that is why
the marines were enabled to make history at Belleau
Woods, which battle included the fight at Chateau
Thierry.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was before noon on the seventeenth of June.
Straggling figures came around a bend in the road
near Meaux—they were French, the advance guards
of the retreating columns that were to follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Folks from the nearby villages crowded the roadside
with tears in their eyes as they watched their
own French soldiers going back and back. It meant
the Germans were coming on toward Paris!</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly it dawned on those French civilians that
American marines, which now were seen approaching,
were going ahead to fill the gap—to take the
place left by their own poilus. The word passed
quickly down the roadside. Girls and women ran
forward with poppies and other blossoms and
pressed them into the hands of the marines. Their
gratitude was pathetic—it impeded the regular line
of march, at first, but after the marines passed,
every man was filled with a determination to make
good.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines had marched about half an hour
when Hal and Chester came across a sight they will
never forget—a long line of stumbling, pitiful refugees.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man behind Hal said two or three times to himself:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Confound ’em!” and there was a murmured re-echo
down the line.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quiet back there!” the platoon leader shouted,
but there was a bit of sympathy in the command.</p>

<p class='c005'>German shells began to fall near the road, thicker
and thicker. They were feeling their way with artillery
for the advance that was to follow. Not so
many kilometers more, and their shells would be
falling on Paris, the German staff thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then came the orders to dig in, and the marines
fell to.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had no time to dig anything but individual
rifle pits that June day, before they got their first
chance to give “Fritz” a taste of the unexpected.
With their bayonets and mess gear they scraped
shallow holes in the ground, and along that afternoon
the Germans marched confidently out of the
woods, across the green wheatfield, in two perfect
columns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the marines opened fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hardly a marine in that regiment, and other regiments
behind—in fact hardly a man in the two divisions
of marines that soon were to battle desperately,
hand-to-hand, with the Germans, that did not
boast a “marksman’s badge”; many were qualified as
sharpshooters and expert riflemen. These men did
not simply raise their rifles and shoot in the general
direction of Germany. They adjusted their sights,
coolly took aim and shot to kill. The Prussians
dropped as if death was wielding a scythe in their
midst, rank after rank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the flower of the German army broke ranks
and took refuge in the woods. But the impudence
of the Americans could not be allowed to go unpunished.
The Germans whipped and slashed that field
of waist-high wheat with such a concentrated machine-gun
fire as neither Hal nor Chester ever expected
to encounter again.</p>

<p class='c005'>But once again the unexpected.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wave after wave of marines rose up in perfect
alignment and charged!</p>

<p class='c005'>Foolhardy? Of course. The marines dropped
in twos, threes and fours, but they advanced.
Whole platoons were wiped out, but the waves never
broke.</p>

<p class='c005'>At a certain point, say books on tactics, the remnants
of decimated forces must waver, give way and
retire. Never were ranks cut up so before, perhaps,
but the book of tactics went awry when those American
youngsters charged! Handfulls of them
reached the trees and put the Boche to flight. Then
they entrenched at the edge of the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the end was not yet. The advance of the
marines continued through the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the very outset they met machine-gun fire; and
out of the wood, after they were in it, came the persistent
rattle of rifle fire, varied by veritable storms
of machine-gun fire. Wounded began to flow back
from the ravines. Calls came for Stokes’ mortars
from the hidden scene of that vicious medley, along
with the report that Colonel Catlin had been
wounded half an hour after the attack began.</p>

<p class='c005'>Machine-gun positions in the outskirts of the
woods had been taken; but they were only the first
lot. Hal had been through many woods where German
machine gunners ensconced themselves, and
none that he remembered afforded better positions
for defense against any enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only was the undergrowth advantageous, but
there were numerous rocks and ravines and pockets,
all of which favored the Germans. There was nothing
new in the system which the enemy applied, but
not until troops go against it for the first time do
they realize its character.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they could locate a gun, the marines concentrated
their rifles upon it. The wounded crawled
back behind rocks or into ravines, or to any place
where they could find a dead space. Hot cries accompanied
the flashing drives of the cold steel
through the underbrush. Many bayonets might
drop from the hands of the men who were hit, but
some bayonets would “get there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal, stopping to get his breath, found time to say
to Chester, who was near him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hot work, old man; but we’re going through!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />CHATEAU THIERRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>That was the thing—to get there!</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines have always fought in that way. It
is tradition—and their nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>German gunners ran from their guns in face of
such assaults; others tried to withdraw their guns;
still others were taken in groups huddled in ravines
as youth, fearful in its white rage of determination,
bore down upon them and gathered them in, or,
again, drove the bayonet home into gunners who
stuck to their posts until the instant that forms,
with eyes gleaming, leapt upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>With captured German machine guns, men, whom
the marines farther back could not reach with food
and water, held their gains, taking food and water
from the American and German dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although the first phase of the attack had not been
fully accomplished, it was determined not to hold
back the other companies, which had been waiting
under shell fire that only aroused their eagerness to
advance, from undertaking the second phase.</p>

<p class='c005'>Theirs was a simpler task than that of their comrades
who had stormed the woods. Artillery preparation
in clearing away was, of course, more serviceable
against a village than against a woods, and
neither machine gun nor shell fire delayed the precision
of the movement across the open to the village
of Chateau Thierry itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the enemy contested every step of the advance.
These troops that the German general staff
now hurled forward to stem the tide of the American
advance were the flower of the emperor’s army—the
Prussian Guards, who boasted that they had
never been stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>But not only were they to be stopped by the impetuous
daring of the Americans, but they were soon
to be driven back in utter rout.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the woods the marines were cheek by jowl with
the enemy, who were slipping more machine guns
into that section of the wood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans must be made to understand that
the woods was the property of the Americans—that
was the thought in the hearts of all the marines as
they went about their work, while the Germans, on
their part, began gassing the approaches both of
Chateau Thierry and Belleau village.</p>

<p class='c005'>The very irregular shape of Belleau Woods, no
less than the character of the ground, favored the
defenders in forming cross zones of fire. It was
a strange and fierce business, there in the dense
brush, where men of the same squad could not keep
in touch with one another at times. Happily the
marines had located some of the enemy nests before
they attacked, but those farther ahead they
could locate only when the Germans began firing,
or when they stumbled upon gunners who were still
hugging cover after the bombardment, or who simply
had concluded it was better to be a live prisoner
than to die for the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were taken in groups and singly, taken
standing behind trees and hugging the holes they
had dug in the earth. Some were trying to retreat
with their guns; others fled precipitately, and many
continued to work their guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a hunt of man-hornet nests, with khaki the
hunter and the German gray the hunted. The marines
fought even more fiercely than in their first
attack. They wanted to finish the job this time; and
the job was to be finished soon.</p>

<p class='c005'>The enemy, smarting under the American success,
began bringing up reserves and concentrated a
terrific artillery fire on the ground close to Chateau
Thierry and the village itself. Chateau Thierry
seemed to have become a point of honor with the
Germans no less than with the Americans. They
saturated it with a bombardment of yperite gas,
which clings to the earth and the trees, and burns
flesh that comes in contact with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the Germans could hardly send their own men
into this area to suffer the effects intended for the
marines, the battle momentarily died down.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it was to be resumed shortly with redoubled
fury.</p>

<p class='c005'>An hour later the Germans, with their reserves,
made an attack in force. By all criterions this attack
should have succeeded. Some Germans penetrated
to within a short distance of the American
lines and a good many of them remained there—dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>American machine-gun fire and rifle fire drove all
who escaped back toward the enemy’s lines. At the
same time, under cover of their artillery, the Germans
had reinforced their machine-gun units, which
remained in the edge of the woods, probably thinking
that as soon as the effects of the yperite were
over, recovery of the woods would not be difficult.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the German staff was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p class='c005'>For perhaps half an hour the battle died down
again. The Germans took advantage of this lull
to reform their lines just beyond Chateau Thierry
and to prepare to repel an attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>From this moment the German staff seems to
have lost all desire of an offensive movement. They
must have realized that the possibility of a further
advance had gone a-glimmering with the defeat of
the Prussian Guard in Belleau Woods. No longer
would the Germans be the aggressors; it would be
the Yankees, and their Allies, from this time on
that would push the fighting.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines were now at full strength—two solid
divisions, except for the losses in the early fighting—and
these had been heavy. Not in the history of
man had there been such a desperate charge as the
marines had made there in Belleau Woods, and it
was to be equalled only by the charge that was to
drive the enemy from Chateau Thierry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Officers hastily looked over the decimated troops
during the brief pause, as they awaited word to advance.
Though their losses had been enormous, and
though it seemed impossible to advance further
through the hail of shells, bullets and shrapnel that
poured upon them, the marines were not daunted.
Their spirit was as superb as when they had first
advanced confidently to the attack. Their morale
was unbroken.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the German staff, and to the German veterans
themselves, it must have been a thing of wonder
the way the American marines stood to their tasks.
True, they were outnumbered by the enemy, but
there wasn’t a man there who stopped to think of
that.</p>

<p class='c005'>Reinforcements were on their way from the rear.</p>

<p class='c005'>American regulars, and the French troops, broken
by the first shock of the German advance, had had
time to regain their lost cohesion and reform. But
it was not General Bundy’s plan to await these reinforcements;
he had the enemy on the run now and
he was not disposed to surrender his advantage.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, after a brief pause, he ordered the attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wild cheers broke from the marines as they darted
upon the enemy machine gunners and artillerymen
who still clung to the edge of the woods. There
was a sharp skirmish, and the Germans abandoned
their guns and fled toward where other lines had
been fortified just before Chateau Thierry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The marines dashed forward on the very heels
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Into the streets of the little village poured the
Americans pell-mell. Here, under the command of
their officers, the Germans braced and their resistance
became stiffer.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the men from Yankeeland were not to be denied.
Absolutely disregarding the enemy machine-gun
fire, that cut great gaps in their lines, they
leaped forward with lowered bayonets. Steel
clashed on steel as the fighting became hand-to-hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here and there marines, crazed with battle, cast
away their rifles and bayonets and dashed upon the
enemy barehanded. Down went Germans before
heavy blows from American fists. Groups of Germans
gathered here and there and attempted to
check the Americans. As well have tried to shut
out a tornado.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Prussian Guards, once the pride of the
German army, became demoralized. Some threw down
their weapons and raised their hands in token of
surrender. Others turned and ran. These latter
the marines pursued, making captives of some and
accounting for others with their rifles and bayonets.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fiercer and fiercer the fighting raged in the streets
of the little village. From one end of the streets,
the enemy covered the marines with machine guns
and fired rapidly as the Americans came toward
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this fire had no more effect than if the Germans
had been spraying the marines with water.
Those who survived the terrible fire leaped over the
bodies of their prostrate comrades and at the throats
of the Huns.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was more than flesh and blood could stand.
The Germans turned and fled in utter rout.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the work of the marines was not yet over.
They pushed on to the edge of the village. Machine
guns were hastily posted and manned and a destructive
fire poured into the ranks of the fleeing enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon the Germans reached the shelter of a distant
woods, posted their own big guns and opened
upon the exposed Yankee positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly General Bundy gave the command to
dig in again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Weapons of warfare were immediately discarded
by the marines for intrenching tools and the dirt
began to fly. American artillery, meantime, hurled
high explosive shells over the heads of the marines
into the German positions beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>Night fell and the duel of big guns continued as
the marines still dug and clawed at the ground. But
before midnight the newly-won positions had been
made secure. Sentinels were posted and the men at
last were permitted to sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not in the history of all wars has there been a
victory to equal that of the American marines in
Belleau Woods and at Chateau Thierry. It was wonderful.
No other word will describe it. And in its
effect, the result was far reaching.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only did the American victory enable the
hard-pressed French troops, so recently driven back
by the German advance, to reform; not only did it
reduce the effectiveness of the German man-power,
but it shattered the morale of the whole German
army. It was the greatest single blow that had been
struck during the war.</p>

<p class='c005'>No wonder the tired American marines slept the
sleep of the just that night. They had been the instruments
that set in motion the great offensive that
was to make the world safe for Democracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a glorious day for America—the seventeenth
of June, 1918!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />BOWERS IN ACTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was the fate of the American marines to be
at the front at a moment when the destiny of the
modern world hung in the balance; and they played
a part that will be gratefully remembered in America,
as well as in western Europe, through generations
to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the day of fierce fighting, Hal and Chester
had been in the foremost of the fight. They had
hugged down in ravines together and together they
had charged the German machine guns at the head
of their men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many officers fell in the early hours of the battle
and long before darkness cast its shadow over the
battlefield captains and lieutenants were occupying
the posts of colonels and majors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nowhere in the field were there more competent
officers than Hal and Chester had long since proven
themselves to be; and the company of marines whose
lot it fell to the lads to lead, soon placed the utmost
confidence in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>This company, in whose ranks was Sergeant Bowers,
had been one of the first to get into the fight,
and although the tired men would have welcomed a
moment’s breathing space from time to time, they
had no breathing space.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was this company which was the first to attack
the enemy in Chateau Thierry itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was after one o’clock in the afternoon when the
order came for the men to leave the comparative
shelter of the woods and move to the attack. The
men cheered wildly as the word was passed. They
had been lying down and plugging away at the
enemy with their rifles. Now they welcomed the
chance that would bring them to hand grips. It was
Chester who gave the word:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forward!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly the men were on their feet and streaming
from the woods into the open place beyond.
Their advance was greeted with a hail of machine-gun
fire, and high explosive shells burst to the right
and to the left of them, and in their midst. But the
men were not dismayed; they showed only a greater
eagerness to get in close.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester waved his sword aloft as he urged his
troops to greater efforts. Hal, close beside his chum,
also brandished his sword and flourished a revolver
in his left hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this manner, in spite of the havoc wreaked in
their lines by the enemy fire, the marines charged
upon the German lines before Chateau Thierry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The opposing lines met with a shock. Men stumbled
forward; others reeled back and dropped to the
ground to rise no more. It was a terrible spectacle,
and Hal and Chester were right in the middle of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this sort of fighting the Germans did not have
a chance with the men from America. Flower of
the German army they were, but never before had
they encountered such determination, such recklessness
and such an unquenchable spirit as the marines
displayed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Give it to ’em, boys!” shouted Hal, as he parried
a thrust from a German officer and fired his revolver
in the man’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>And give it to ’em the marines did!</p>

<p class='c005'>The men had advanced, cheering; now they became
strangely quiet, bending all their energies toward
subduing the foe. Slowly the Germans gave
ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>Into the streets of the village the marines advanced
on the very heels of the enemy. Chester and
Hal posted them in little groups at advantageous
points while, they awaited the arrival of reinforcements,
which even now could be seen advancing in
the distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>From a house to the left a machine gun crackled
suddenly. Half a dozen men near Hal tumbled
over. Hal acted quickly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sergeant Bowers!” he called sharply. “Take a
dozen men and capture that house! Stay,” he added
as Bowers hurried away, “I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a word to Chester, Hal dashed after Sergeant
Bowers and the dozen men.</p>

<p class='c005'>To reach the house it was necessary to brave the
fire of the machine gun, which covered the approach
to the building. But this Hal did not hesitate to
order his men to do, for by no other means, he saw,
could the place be captured, and he realized, too,
that it must be captured at all hazards.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine gun spat viciously at the Americans,
but they advanced unflinchingly. Two men fell and
two others cursed, by which Hal knew they had been
hit. So there were only ten men besides Hal and
Sergeant Bowers who reached the house, and two
of these were wounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the door of the building the Americans were
out of range of the machine gun, which still poured
bullets over their heads. The door was locked.
Bowers and a private named Timothy put their
shoulders to it and it flew open with a crash.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upstairs, men!” cried Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers reached the steps first and sprang up
three at a time. Hal and the others were close behind
him. At the top, Bowers led the way along the
narrow hall toward the room where the German machine
gun was posted. The door to this room also
was locked. Again Bowers and Timothy brought
their sturdy shoulders into use and the door gave
way beneath their weight. At the moment of the
crash, Hal shouted:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Down on the floor, men!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was well that he did so.</p>

<p class='c005'>The German machine gunner within had acted
just as Hal had surmised he would. When he
heard the intruders at the door, he turned his gun
so that it commanded the entrance; and when the
door fell inward, he opened fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>But thanks to Hal’s prompt action, the Americans
escaped unscathed. From his position on the floor,
Hal raised his revolver, took careful aim and fired.
The German gunner inside the room threw up his
hands, staggered to his feet, spun around twice on
his heel and rolled over like a log.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, men,” said Hal calmly. “Grab that
gun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So the gun was in the possession of the Americans,
and it had been captured with the loss of only
two men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hal approached the window and looked out. He
saw Chester and his men forming to repel an attack
that the enemy was about to launch. The reinforcements
had not arrived yet and Chester’s company
faced the alternative of standing firm in the face
of superior numbers or retiring. Hal saw that
Chester had determined to fight it out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Foolish, perhaps,” he told himself, “but I don’t
blame him. Well, maybe I can help a bit. Bowers!”
The sergeant saluted. “Train the gun on the enemy
advancing there,” Hal continued. “They make a
good target. We should be able to break up the attack
with this single gun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers needed no urging. With his own hands
he whirled the gun about so it again pointed
through the window. Then, without waiting for
further orders, he opened fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The steady stream of machine-gun bullets opened
a wide gap in the ranks of the oncoming enemy. As
quickly as these gaps were filled by reserve troops,
the gun manned by Bowers mowed them down
again. There was a slight smile on Bowers’ face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will make us come three thousand miles to
settle this argument, will you?” he muttered. “Well,
you’ll get more than you bargained for, Fritz; much
more!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the hail of bullets from the single machine
gun and the rifle fire from Chester’s troops below,
the German line wavered along its entire length.
Then the Germans broke and fled.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same moment, the first of the marine reinforcements
poured into the streets of the village.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Chateau Thierry had not yet been entirely
cleared of the enemy. From the windows of many
houses German snipers, singly and in groups, picked
off the Americans from these shelters. Hal, glancing
from the window, was able to see better than
was Chester below the points where lay the greatest
danger to the marines.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bowers!” he called.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sergeant stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See that house across the street?” asked Hal,
pointing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes sir!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good! You take five men and clean up the Germans
there. I’ll take the other five and drive out
the enemy stationed in the house next to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bowers turned and called five marines by name.
The men gathered around him and the sergeant led
the way from the house. Hal, with his five marines,
sallied forth after the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the street, the force divided, Sergeant Bowers
and his men dashed up the steps of the first
house, burst open the door and disappeared within.
Hal led his men next door.</p>

<p class='c005'>As it developed, Hal had picked out the most difficult
task for Sergeant Bowers and his men. As
the door burst in under the blows of the marines,
Sergeant Bowers, in advance, saw that the lower
hall was filled with Germans.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it was too late to draw back now. Besides,
the lives of many Americans outside lay in the
hands of these foes should the little party of Americans
fail to conquer them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Down, men!” cried the sergeant, and the first
volley from the Germans passed harmlessly over
their heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fire!” shouted Sergeant Bowers, and from their
positions flat on the floor the five marines swung
their rifles into position and blazed away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans received the bullets standing. Apparently
they had no leader of such quick decision
as Sergeant Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Up and at them!” shouted the sergeant.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a cheer the little handful of marines obeyed
orders.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another volley the Germans fired, but their nerves
appeared to have been shattered and the bullets went
wild with one exception. A ball pierced Sergeant
Bowers’ left shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a yell of anger, Sergeant Bowers hurled his
empty revolver into the very faces of the enemy
and dashed forward with his naked hands, his big
fingers twisting spasmodically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shoot me, will you?” he howled. “Shoot me,
will you? Take that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He struck out with his great right fist and one
German soldier crumpled up and slid gently to the
floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shoot me, will you?” yelled the sergeant again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />VICTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Appalled by the fury in the face of Sergeant
Bowers, the Germans retreated along the wall, two
to one as they were.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nail ’em, Timothy!” shouted Bowers to the
marine who was nearest him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Timothy grinned and pulled the trigger of his
rifle again. The other marines also poured a volley
into the compact ranks of the foe. Three Germans
dropped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good boy!” yelled Bowers. “At ’em again!”</p>

<p class='c005'>With wild cries, the Germans broke and fled for
the steps at the end of the hall. Up these they
climbed pell-mell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After ’em, men!” shouted Bowers. “I’ll lick
the man who lets one of ’em get away!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Up the steps after the Germans piled the marines.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the top of the stairs, the Germans turned and
poured a volley into the marines. One man staggered,
but recovered himself and went forward
again. At the end of the hall was a small ladder
which led to the roof of the building. Fear lent
wings to the Germans, who shot up the ladder with
swiftness and dispatch. There was a loud bang as
the trap door above was dropped into place even as
Bowers’ head would have passed through the opening.
The result was that Bowers bumped his head
against the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Drat ’em!” exclaimed the sergeant. “They’ve
got clear. Well, we’ve got to get ’em; that’s all
there is about that. Timothy, you and the others
hop out of here and head ’em off if they try to get
down through the house to the left. I’ll stay here
in case they come back this way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But——” began Timothy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You heard me, didn’t you?” demanded Bowers
angrily. “Who’s the sergeant here, I want to know,
huh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right. It’s your funeral,” said Timothy with
a shrug. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He led the way from the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile, Hal and his men, who had entered
the house to the right of that in which Sergeant
Bowers now stood guard alone, had encountered
stiff opposition within. They found the Germans
outnumbered them greatly, but Hal was not disposed
to give up.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans, of course, were not able to make
sure of the number of the Americans and for this
reason they retreated upstairs when the front door
was knocked in. They fired at the first head to
show itself in the opening, but not a bullet struck
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the second floor, these Germans also
climbed to the roof and closed the trap-door, thus
balking Hal and his men of their prey.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They went up,” said Hal. “They’ll have to come
down some time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They may pass on to the next house and go down
that way, sir,” one of the men suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll find Sergeant Bowers there,” replied
Chester significantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They may go the other way, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They can’t,” said Hal. “I noticed as we came in
that there are only three houses whose roofs are
close enough to be jumped. The only danger of
our losing them is that they will pass the next house
and descend in the one at the end. You men get
out of here quick and guard the end house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean to stay here alone, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly,” said Hal. “Now hurry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guess I’ll try it,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men waited no longer.</p>

<p class='c005'>For some moments Hal stood quietly at the foot
of the ladder debating whether he should await the
return of the Germans there or whether he should
risk a shot and open the trap door.</p>

<p class='c005'>He mounted the ladder rapidly and cautiously
pushed up the trap-door. A strange sight met his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>A dozen figures sprang from the farthest building
to the one next to the lad. Behind them came
three or four American marines. Hal realized at
once that Sergeant Bowers had taken the same precautions
he had to prevent the escape of the enemy
and had sent his men, or some of them, into the far
house.</p>

<p class='c005'>The foremost German caught sight of Hal’s head
and with a cry stopped short on the roof of the middle
building.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Down this way!” he cried, and lifted the trap-door
of the building on which he stood.</p>

<p class='c005'>He leaped down. Others piled after him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Going to be quite a scrap there,” muttered Hal.
“Guess I’d better take a hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With no thought of the risk he was running, he
sprang to the roof and dashed toward the enemy.
From the last of the three houses, the marines also
advanced on the run.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the foot of the ladder where he had stationed
himself, Sergeant Bowers was not caught unprepared
when the trap-door was flung suddenly open
and the first German leaped down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thought you’d be back,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>His fist shot out as the German reached the floor
and the man dropped in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One!” said the sergeant with a half smile.
“Next!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Germans came down the ladder so swiftly
now that Sergeant Bowers was smothered beneath
them. In vain he struck out right and left. Two
men went down under his sledge-hammer blows, but
the enemy arrived faster than Bowers could dispose
of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Directly the sergeant found himself at bay, fully
a dozen Germans circling about him with ugly
gleams in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed that the foes had run short of ammunition;
otherwise Bowers must surely have perished
where he stood before help could reach him. But no
shot was fired. Nevertheless, the Germans were
armed with knives and daggers, while Bowers had
no weapons save his two great fists.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was apparent, however, that the cowardly foes
had a wholesome respect for these fists. Each appeared
afraid to close in—each waited for the next
man to strike the first blow. Sergeant Bowers
stood with his back to the wall and taunted them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on, you cowards!” he called. “Come in
here and meet an American marine!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans muttered angrily, but no man
seemed anxious to be the first to attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still, it was plain to Sergeant Bowers that they
must attack soon or be caught like rats in a trap.
The position where the sergeant stood at bay had a
certain advantage; for the Germans to reach the
steps leading to the floor below it would be necessary
to pass within a few feet of him. And Sergeant
Bowers had decided with himself that he
would never allow the Germans to pass there while
he remained alive.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Germans now began to realize the need of
haste; and this haste became greater as a marine
came sliding down the ladder from the roof. With
bellows of fury they sprang upon Sergeant Bowers
and the new arrival.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sergeant and the private fought as best they
could. They struck out right and left with all their
strength.</p>

<p class='c005'>But gradually they felt themselves being pushed
back. Bowers felt a slight pain in his left forearm
as a knife found its mark. A moment later a shining
blade grazed his forehead. With an angry bellow,
the sergeant sprang into the very midst of his
foes.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was at this moment that Hal reached the opening
in the roof and came scrambling down to the aid
of the hard-pressed Americans below. From the
roof of the adjoining building, the other marines
now streamed to join the fight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Realizing that the game was up in this direction,
the Germans turned to flee. Bowers and the first
marine to come to his assistance had been forced to
give ground enough to permit the enemy the access
of the stairs leading to the ground floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Down these the Germans dashed madly, each man
upbraiding the other for blocking his progress. At
the bottom of the stairs, they hurried toward the
broken front door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even as the first man would have stepped out, a
figure in khaki appeared in the doorway, a revolver
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Chester, who, now that the enemy had been
driven from Chateau Thierry, had come to make
sure of the safety of Hal and his companions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hah!” cried the foremost German, and stopped
dead in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hands up!” cried Chester in German.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instead of obeying this command, however, the
Germans inside turned quickly and dashed into a
room on the first floor. Quickly they locked and
barred the door before either Chester or the Americans
descending from above could halt them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chester stopped before this door. His eyes
searched the steps at the end of the hall down which
the marines, headed by Bowers, now ran.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” came his chum’s voice from above.
“I’m here, but don’t you let those fellows get away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a chance,” laughed Chester as Hal, Bowers
and the others came up to him. “They’re in this
room here, and I guess they’ll stay there until they
get ready to surrender.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the windows?” suggested Sergeant Bowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Guarded,” replied Chester briefly. “By Jove,
sergeant! You look like you had been in a fight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I have, sir,” declared the sergeant grimly,
“but if you’ll bother to go to the top of yonder steps
you’ll find half a dozen men who look a whole lot
worse than I do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve no doubt of it, sergeant,” laughed Chester.
“But you’d better have those wounds dressed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not until we’ve rounded up the gang in there,
sir,” said Sergeant Bowers, pointing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, that should be simple enough,” declared
Hal. “Break in the door, men!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Three marines laid their shoulders to the door
and heaved lustily. There was the sound of splintering
wood, and the door flew open. The marines
dropped hastily to the floor, anticipating a volley of
rifle bullets, but no such volley came.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instead, Hal and Chester, looking into the room,
beheld an amusing sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Facing the door, their hands high above their
heads, their faces bearing every appearance of the
utmost terror, were twelve Germans, the sole survivors
of the enemy force that had defended the two
houses now in the possession of the marines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their faces blanched as Hal, Chester and Sergeant
Bowers took a step forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kamerad!” they cried. “Kamerad! Kamerad!”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the work of only a few minutes to make
prisoners of these men, after which, under guard,
they were marched out and turned over to the
proper authorities.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fighting in Chateau Thierry had ceased. The
duel of big guns still raged, but the American mastery
of Chateau Thierry and the whole of Belleau
Woods no longer could be disputed.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was 10 o’clock that night when Hal and Chester
found themselves alone in their temporary quarters
in Chateau Thierry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, we went through ’em, old boy,” said Hal
quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course,” said Chester. “And from this time
we’ll go through ’em almost at will. And it was
the Prussian Guard we licked. Think of that! The
pride of the German emperor—the best troops he
boasted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark my words,” said Hal, “while the fighting
is by no means over, this is the beginning of the end.
We’ve met the best the enemy had to offer and it
wasn’t good enough. They’ve lost thousands upon
thousands. Their morale is shattered at last. Oh,
they’ll probably fight on and on, but from this time
forward there can be no doubt of the ultimate result.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right.” Chester agreed. “As our friend Bowers
would say, ‘They’re through!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, as it developed, the lads were right. It was
at Chateau Thierry that American marines struck
the blow that broke the backbone of German resistance.
However, there was to be more severe
fighting and in it both Hal and Chester were to play
their parts. Their later adventures will be found in
a succeeding volume, entitled, “<span class='sc'>The Boy Allies
with the Great Advance; or, Driving the Foe
Through France and Belgium</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>CAPTAIN JACK LORIMER</b>; or, The Young Athlete of Millvale High.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jack Lorimer is a fine example of the all-around American
high-school boys. His fondness for clean, honest sport
of all kinds will strike a chord of sympathy among athletic
youths.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>JACK LORIMER’S CHAMPIONS</b>; or, Sports on Land and Lake.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a lively story woven in with the athletic achievements,
which are all right, since the book has been O. K’d.
by Chadwick, the Nestor of American Sporting journalism.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>JACK LORIMER’S HOLIDAYS</b>; or, Millvale High in Camp.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would be well not to put this book into a boy’s hands
until the chores are finished, otherwise they might be
neglected.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>JACK LORIMER’S SUBSTITUTE</b>; or, The Acting Captain of the Team.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the sporting side, this book takes up football, wrestling,
and tobogganing. There is a good deal of fun in this book
and plenty of action.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>JACK LORIMER, FRESHMAN</b>; or, From Millvale High to Exmouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jack and some friends he makes crowd innumerable happenings
into an exciting freshman year at one of the leading
Eastern colleges. The book is typical of the American
college boy’s life, and there is a lively story, interwoven
with feats on the gridiron, hockey, basketball and other
clean honest sports for which Jack Lorimer stands.</p>
